Irrespective of whichever religion I believe in, I truly belive that my purspose in life is to help others. That means, going out to the shelter and volunteering, donating cloth or even go as far as going to another country and donating your time. Why is it that we feel good when we help other people? I think that good feeling we get from helping other people is instilled into our souls. Why is it that people will acquire money as the sole purpose in their life? Why is it that people feel like their purpose in life is to leave a legacy? Why is that when we help people, it makes us feel good?Why should we let society dictate how we should live our lives?I personally think it is horrible that their are people out there who struggle with the basic nessecity of life like food and shelter, but for us, we argue about some jerk cut us off on our way to work.

hdbwh,35972,trees,1305637147,I have a story to share with you.,"We went out to a party one cold, snowy winter night. So around 2 am, we decide we better leave because the roads were turning out treacherous. On our way home we see a car that had clearly lost control on the shitty roads and had fallen victim to the ditch. In our car are the driver who is at a [7], a friend we like to call blackout who is both drunk and high and myself who is also at a [7]. My friend looks at me and says ""should we?"" and without much hesitation I said yes. We pull over to find that the driver is **8 and a half month pregnant** and her female friend who trying unsuccessfully to push the car out of the snow. She couldn't contain her happiness when 3 guys came out of a car to help them. So at the count of 3, driver, blackout and I push the car out successfully. Before she drove off, she was about to cry because she was so happy someone had pulled over to help her so late into the night. This concludes my story and I am glad I am able to share it with you!**TL;DR We are high, shitty Canadian winter, found a car stuck in ditch, she was 8.5 month pregnant, we pushed her car out.** **EDIT** I didn't expect this kind of response :-). This is seriously great, I'm glad you enjoyed it! I'm listening to [this](_URL_ and I'm so fucking happy!. I'm at a [8], too!"

I mentioned that people who tend to have social anxiety don't tend to be very happy people...and I believe I can say that because I was once there.We then discussed on how people who have social anxiety would absolutely love to a social person person they can relate to and talk about anything. As someone who has had social anxiety, I can see how it affects our lives negatively. Also, it is very difficult for people with social anxiety to meet other people.What I'm proposing is a Rent-a-buddy system (completely volunteer). The system would allow anybody who requested a friend to go hang out with them to shoot the shit and have a good time. It might sound silly, but if you're a happy guy, and you know you can make another person happy by being in their presence, why not?If you think it's a stupid idea, downvote and move on, fellow Ents."

I really need your input.","Hello. There is a lot on my mind, so please bear with me if my ideas are scattered and disorganized. I've always thought myself as lesser intelligence when I was young. My older brother was given an intelligence test when he was younger and scored in the high 90's. When I took the exact same test, I ended up with a less than 10% on the test. As a result, I was given a guidance counselor in High School.I went to a french high school until grade 9. During my time in the french high school system, I was failing a lot of my classes. I never paid attention, and I was always more interested in goofing around than paying attention. Eventually, I switched into an English high school system and did mildly better. I was passing, but not by a whole lot. I was always getting c's in most of my classes. When I wrote exams, I was given a lot of extra time to write because I had an individual education plan by my HS. I hated this, though because I didn't want to be different from the other kids. I wanted to be the same as them, so by grade 12 I was writing exams with all the other kids and wasn't getting special treatment by the HS guidance counselor. By some miracle, however I ended up getting a 75 average by grade 12 and was allowed to enter University to study Accounting. My first semester was horrid, where I achieved a D+ average in my first semester. I didn't apply myself, and I thought I was going to either get kicked out or drop out. My parents were really supportive, though and helped motivate me to keep going. I'm in my 5th year in Accounting and doing decent (c+ average right now). I honestly believe if I didn't have the support of my parents I wouldn't be where I am today.During my exams, I make very stupid mistakes that if only I had paid attention to the detail, I would have gotten a higher mark. When I write exams, I'll start question 1, go to question 4 and answer it really quickly, then jump back to question 1. This is a recurring theme with all my university exams. More often than not, I'll finish about 95% of my final and I'll just stop writing. At that point of the exam, I don't care anymore and just hand it in. The idea of redoing a problem because I might have done something wrong makes me break out in cold sweats. I know I've done a problem wrong, but I don't care and I just hand it in. I'll never fully complete my readings for my classes. I'll set up 6-8 hours to study a chapter even though I only need something like 2-3 hours if only I apply myself. I can't though because I'll read a sentence, zone out for a few minutes, and zone back in. I have good intentions when I study, but it won't matter because no matter how hard I try to study, this keeps on happening. Also, I'll never completely finish reading a chapter. I'll stop when I finish reading about 85-90% of the chapter and do something else. There are a few things that came to mind when I began to think I might have ADD. For instance, when I do presentations, I often trail off my thinking and begin to say really stupid things in front of my peers. I wouldn't be thinking about what I practiced to say, and it would lead me to say things that weren't even relevant to my presentation. Another thing is that fidget A LOT. In class, I never stay still. I always have to have something in my hand. I twitch and and move around a lot. Whatever position I'm sitting in isn't comfortable enough...so I keep moving. During lectures, I can barely stay focus. My mind is always trailing off about something else. Coffee doesn't work for me, it pretty much keeps me neutral, so whenever I go to class with a coffee, it does nothing but make me want to take a shit. I'm always tired even though I get plenty of sleep a night (8-9 hours a night). Let's say I'm about to do 3 things on the computer. They are all easy tasks, but I never complete them...I always do about half and then I just stop. For instance, I'll be updating my facebook status and just before I finish I go into my email. I begin to write a response and then I'll stop and go to reddit and read an article. I won't finish reading the article, I will pause whatever I'm doing and I'll realize that I forgot to update my facebook status. At that point it's been about 20 mins since I opened facebook to update my status. I always want to understand how to do things right away...I'm really impatient. Due to this, I've pretty much found it impossible to learn new things that require a learning curve. I want to start mixing music, so I'll download the program, open it, try to understand it right away and just close it the second I get flustered.  I don't read books. I don't only dislike books, I hate them. I want to be able to sit for hours on end and read a book, but I simply cannot do that because I get bored too easily and just do something else. In grade 12 English, I was forced to get an audiobook for my book that I was supposed to read because I couldn't read the material without forgetting what I just read or I just lose interest.I find it extremely difficult when somebody wants me to learn something quickly and I simply cannot do it. Somebody will tell me how to get to a certain place of town, and I'll almost immediately forget it, even though I understood what that person was saying. I can't even watch complex movies because I can't pay attention to a movies dialogue. My mind is always thinking about something else. I'll have dialogue with somebody and more often then not I'll ask them to repeat what they were saying because my mind went somewhere else. I talk a lot and I definitely intrude on other peoples conversation. My group of friends know I do this quite often, and are perfectly fine with it.It's weird, because when I start to talk about topics that are of high interest for me, my mind begins to race. I begin to make little speeches and I definitely capture the attention of the people I talk to. One girl I talked to recently told me I should be a public speaker because of the way I talk. I told her I only talk like this when I start talking about topics that really interest me...every other topic my speech changed completely.       I have a solid understanding of how feelings work and the concept of love. When I begin to talk about that, my mind starts to race and I talk about it for hours on end. I've had an 8 hour conversation with a girl about love, feelings, and the philosophies of life. Sorry to have ranted off like this, but I really need your input!"

nrc15,35972,ADD,1324924512,An update.,"[Original Post](_URL_ listened to my story and you helped me. You motivated me to go talk to my doctor and get tested. I ended up having an hour conversation with my doctor about my life and why I was lead to believe that I have ADD. In the end, she said with full confidence that I do indeed have it, and she prescribed medication (concerta-18 mg).The difference my life has taken is CRAZY. I'm more consistent, I can focus and I don't sound like an air head in conversations. I actually have motivation to do anything I want. Before, doing simple tasks like writing my resume or applying for jobs was the toughest thing is the world. Now, I don't even think about mundane tasks. I just do it, and it feels amazing.I've lived with this for 22 years of my life, convinced that my life was something I couldn't change no matter how hard I tried. Not anymore. I feel like a new person. I've been given the opportunity to start a new life at 22 years old. I'm going to do things I never thought were possible.You've given me the courage to talk to my doctor and as a result, I've been given the opportunity to change my life for the better.**Fucking thank you**"

While medication helped, I didn't want to depend on them entirely. After some research, I purchased piracetam with the intent that it be used along side a smaller dose of amphetamines. Now, I have experienced a lot with piracetam with and without amphetamines. Without amphetamines, piracetam has helped a lot with conversation and sociability. Taken with amphetamines, it helps with motivation and essentially removes my brain fog that I know all too well. For the past 2 weeks, my daily supplement stack has been:When I wake up, 2.4g piracetam + 30 mg vyvanse.3 hours later, 2.4g piracetam.3 hours later, 1.8g piracetam + 10 mg dexedrine.This has been working quite well for me as of late, but given my lack of experience with other racetams, I'm curious to know what I can be doing to help with some of the deficiencies that are tied to having ADHD. For example, only now have I realized that being tired all the time (with a proper sleeping schedule), isn't normal.Cheers, and thank you so much for reading. All your help is much appreciated."

You have given me the ability to be confident with my own thoughts and feelings, and the change that my life has taken is something that I could NEVER imagine myself being in.I battled with the thought of how I could give back to the reddit community. Many people told me I should be a public speaker, or some sort of motivator speaker, but I didn't really believe them because I struggled so much trying to speak with fluidity. I would stutter, stop my thought process, and completely forget what I was talking about. My goodness, even with all the crappy deficiencies with my speech, I still kept working towards a passion I didn't even know existed at the time. When I younger, I loved to talk. I talked a lot. My problem, though was that everyone else I was socializing with could speak better than I ever could. It was demoralizing, humiliating, and down right depressing. I honestly felt bad for talking, because I could NEVER complete my thought process.8 month after my diagnoses, my life has changed in a way I never thought possible.

I've been keeping busy with life, just going to work everyday from 8 30 am to 4 30 pm. I usually get up for 7 20, do some shoulder stretches for a minute or so and go to the washroom. Get ready I leave at 8 am, and it usually takes anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes to get to work.So I work at an accounting office, and I must say I am quite satisfied with the job. It challenges me to focus on my detail orientation skill and that is a great skill to have.I have a cup of coffee in the morning and I lunch at noon for an hour. I work until 4 30 and do any number of things.From there my evening can be any number of things. For example, yesterday I went to dinner with my girlfriend and her best friend at a chinese buffet. Other nights I go over to a friends house to veg out. Sometimes I go to my girlfriends house. Other times I run errands. I don't really plan much into the future. I tend to live in the moment when a decision needs to be made.Motivation to record speeches will be boosted when I have the necessary funds to purchase a laptop.

I do have a motorcycle (kawasaki ninja _PERSON_ if anyone was curious) and I plan to take my laptop and record speeches out in the middle of nowhere, parched on the side of the road, ready to motivate the fuck out of you.I enjoy putting myself in a forward thinking mindset because it helps me make clear, concise and important decision in my life.

I know someone has already deleted their thread, and I'm sad (more than I'd like to admit) because I've been thinking about recording that specific person's motivational speech everyday. Life is a challenge, and I'm striving to understand it, work within it, and thrive on it. Life likes you kick you down, but it's just a matter of keeping your head above water**To all the Redditors who have messaged me and have not received a reply, do not take this as a personal attack at your personality, I love each and every one of you. I have failed you, and I will make this right. Message me right away**."

Time to change that, :).","Hello awesome people, I hope all of you are doing well in life, that you're working towards your long term goals one day at a time. At the very least, I hope you're eating healthy and moderately exercising!My life has been more or less a roller coaster the last couple of months. Been slacking on my exercise and slipped into a bit of a depression. Domestic life isn't the prettiest, but I'm working hard to make my life sustainable in the future. I'm finally starting to get back into a routine. Working out, eating decently, and recording more messages for strangers on the internet :).I went ahead and bought a webcam to start recording YouTube videos, but I'm hesitating so damn much. At this point, it really isn't hesitating, but it's procrastination. These are the types of questions I ask myself every I want to record a video:*Am I engaging enough to maintain a fanbase? Am I doomed to fail from the start? What if people start making fun of me?* etc etc...I know I am creating these problems in my head, but doing something you've never done before is creating feelings of doubt. I guess I got comfortable recording voice recordings, but including your face in video is slightly more personal. One day at a time, I'm positive I'll get over this fear and jump in with both feet in.My gut is telling me I will be successful in reaching my videos across the world, but I'm still hesitating! I guess talking about it helps, heh. Having this message exist serves me a great purpose. I'll be referencing my message like a journal in the near future. I guess this will help me measure my progress.If you've taken the time to read this, I am happy. Thank you for being part of my passion. My ultimate dream is to create a social network of genuine people to help people across the world. One step at a time! I just need to be patient, keep working hard, and never let fear hold me back from what I want from life."

1hyphk,6789,asktransgender,1373406653,A bit of mid transition clothes to give away. In Maryland.,"I no longer feel restricted on what I can wear, so I'm phasing out all the clothes I'll no longer need. I have a bit of transitional clothes that I originally got to feel more comfortable before I was out to everyone. Stuff that's a bit more slim and fitting without being too feminine. If anyone's interested I have:* A few pairs of pants, mostly from H&amp;M all around size 30x32. For those that don't know H&amp;M is fairly androgynous with a lot of their stuff so these are pretty great. I still wear a few that are ""male"".* A few long sleeve t-shirts and button up shirts, most all of them size small in mens. I would use these with jackets and girls tank tops to wear a lot of layers. (as this was during last winter) Layers seem pretty feminine most of the time I think.I've also got a bit of other guy clothes I'd love to give out, but being 6'1"", 145 pounds it may be hard to find a trans guy that would fit them? If anyone(trans or otherwise) wants some dress pants, dress shirts, and a whole suit I'd love to give them away.Otherwise, I'm in Maryland, situated between DC Baltimore and Annapolis, so if your interested and anywhere around here, reply here/message me and we'll figure out where to meet up. edit: [Here's](_URL_ what some of it looks like on me now. Not the most feminine stuff in the world, but it helped me start feeling a bit better about myself. Like I said I'd wear lots of layers, and slim pants. I also liked to just button the couple bottom buttons so the top half could hang looser off my chest and give me a little pseudo boob. I'd say it overall fit better and looked nicer than how most [boy clothes](_URL_ did.^though ^I ^do ^kinda ^still ^like ^this ^shirt*Disclaimer: You can't have the necklace though, too bad.*"

It seemed to be lag but it was every time the gate popped and it made laning impossible. After a couple mins of this going on i dropped my effects quality to low but it did not help. I googled the problem and saw a couple people recently getting this issue.So my question is Does anyone else have this issue?,and if so any solutions?"

Hansel and Gretel decide to separate and Revy returns home. Gretel corners Eda, and while holding her as a hostage, requests that she find a getaway boat for herself and her brother. Meanwhile, the Visotoniki engage Hansel and despite his best efforts, suffer no casualties while attacking him for an entire night. Hansel eventually encounters Balalaika in a park, but is sniped by her men. Elsewhere, Gretel hires the Lagoon Company to transport her, and _PERSON_ listens to her recount her past. Sickened at the situation she had to endure due to Ceauşescu's regime and black marketeers, he vents his anger at _PERSON_, who asserts that _PERSON_ cannot prevent all the injustice in the world. When the Black Lagoon reaches the getaway point, Gretel is killed by a hired gun from Hotel Moscow, but _PERSON_ notes that she died peacefully staring at the sky.

1ibfvc,50962,leagueoflegends,1373859940,Would a range-scaling blitz hook make sense?,"_PERSON_ and his kit are pretty weak aside from the godlike hook. The sheer power of that hook means that nothing else he does can be that spectacular as evidenced by his many, many nerfs that have left him in a fairly weak condition. He is a one ability champ that pretty much could have just his hook and could still be useful. That's an exaggeration but there's some truth to it.What if his hook range scaled with its level so that at early levels it was a little harder to snowball a lane off of one hook? Displacements are strong so even at maybe half range he could have some impact, especially with that knock up. It would force a low level blitz to stick his neck out to be really aggressive in lane and with invade.

1tst03,50962,leagueoflegends,1388139168,An idea for rylais/frozen mallet,"Right now frozen mallet is an expensive gold sink without a lovely build path (I'd say the same for rylais but there don't seem to be many complaints lodged against it). We lost phage from FM because it no longer slowed because riot doesn't like rng or the possibility of an early game permaslow. My idea is to introduce a health based ice item with an active that applies a moderate slow. This gives cc light champs a potential to get the slow that old phage gave without the worry of rng or unfair permanency. Depending on the stats people think would be fair, it could build into both of the frosty end-game weapons. My thought is build it from giants belt and give it a similar cost to the old phage. Maybe it could be true ice based and incorporate itself into an art update for the other weapons. Thoughts? Comments? I'd love to hear them!"

217n3n,50962,leagueoflegends,1395642390,Executioners calling should actually feel like an executing item.,"Right now EC is a pretty lackluster item with a really strong potential niche. Healing reduction against the likes of soraka or mundo is incredibly strong which is exactly why the rest of the stats have to be so bad. If it were good, then you'd almost always get it just so that no one could ever life steal. Now, morellonomicon is such a different item because it has good stats but also the caveat that targets have to be low. This means that if you burst someone down, all your hard work won't go to waste, but also that your long range poke doesn't completely screw over a team.Now, I'm sure EC could use a re-adjustment but what about an upgrade that really feels like an executing item. Something that if you're fighting a low target, you can almost guarantee you will get the kill. Like what if it was a reverse maw of malmortious where its stats were buffed based on how low they were, or added a little bit of true damage if they got below 30%?What do you think?"

We both deal pretty significantly with anxiety and depression that comes from having a hard time with college. We were both overachievers in high school and for at least part of college but now our lives are confusing and we're struggling with our directions in lives. She's consumed by a depression and a self described hatred for everything in her life. She has a pretty big coop at an engineering company that she's been having a hard time with recently after being successful at the start. She now thinks she hates doing what her degree will be in and feels she doesn't have any meaningful life outside of that.So, after her first visit to a therapist (a long time coming) she comes to me and tells me we need to break up so that she can focus on herself for a bit. She puts a lot of stock in our relationship, so much so that it was one of her only sources of happiness so when I invariably messed up or didn't give her the attention she needed she internalized that as her not being good enough (she's very hard on herself). Her logic was that she needs to function on her own and get her life together without me being around to help her function. After much weeping and moping I convince her to take me back but under the condition that I stand back and let her try to function on her own... but even then after this time of limited contact she may choose that she can't do the relationship. I cannot lose this girl. I understand her need for space but she is in such a dark place that without someone helping a little bit I don't think she can motivate herself to make the changes she needs. So far I've barely talked to her but have been linking articles for her to read and made some suggestions of things she could try to do to find her own identity. I want to help her while giving her the space she desires and show her that she doesn't need to sacrifice what a wonderful thing we have to do so. Honestly, I just want her to be happy.   tl;dr: Girlfriend hates her life, fixates too much on me, so decides I must go."

I'm hesitant to post on /r/islam because they tend to be pretty anti-anyone-who-wants-to-shed-light-on-the-evils-of-islam, but I was wondering if anyone here has spent more time studying the Qur'an than I have and can come up with an explanation that is satisfactory. A verse for an example is &gt; 4:89 They long that ye should disbelieve even as they disbelieve, that ye may be upon a level (with them). So choose not friends from them till they forsake their homes in the way of Allah; if they turn back (to enmity) then take them and kill them wherever ye find them, and choose no friend nor helper from among them,The only explanation I got was a character attack ""You haven't read the Qur'an"" (which is actually kind of funny if it weren't such a sad defense), which is clearly not good enough for me.

My question is this: what are our responsibilities with regards to this? If the same person had said ""I beat my kid so hard last night with my belt that he asked when he could die"", we'd have a clear responsibility to report then to Child Protective Services and get that kid out of a dangerous situation.

I got back a few days ago and figured I should post a followup and share my experiences. **Downtown**Dundas and Richmond is where I spent most of my time and I loved it. The character of the buildings and the broad range of things to do kept me busy for a long time. Sadly, I didn't make it to half of the things I wanted, but the places I did hit were all great. Some notable examples are:1. _PERSON_'. Best tap line I saw, by far. If I lived here, I'd spend a lot of money there. 2. Barney's/Ceeps. Lots of fun, nachos were out of hand (our group didn't finish them), and packed full of young people. 3. The Morrissey House. Great good, though we may have annoyed our waitress. 4. _PERSON_'s. _PERSON_, booze, basement bar. Do I need to say more?5. Prince _PERSON_'s. Until then, I hadn't had a perogie. This place was outstanding. 6. _PERSON_ (I know it's a chain). Great steaks! From someone who is from an area that has great beef, I was very impressed. Also, the waiter gave us a tour of the restaurant when he found out we weren't from around. Also the waitress we had was gorgeous ;). **Other Places**Additionally, Victory and Harris park were both gorgeous. I made it to Labatt as well (of course), and it was well worth the trip. **Observations**1. Metric. I am so jealous. It just makes sense. 2. Washrooms. We call them bathrooms or restrooms. I think your way also makes more sense, as we rarely take baths or rests in public bathrooms/restrooms. 3. You guys use the word ""coin"" to mean ""cash"" or ""money"" (i.e. ""Hey guys, you got any spare coin?""). Makes sense because your small change is literally coins.4. Everyone says ""eh"". Seriously. 5. Stoplights. You generally have only one above all lanes moving the same direction. In the US we have one per lane. I almost missed a few of these on the first day because of this. 6. Streetsigns are smaller in London. 7. Everyone seems to have a story about some haunted building they were in once. 8. EVERYONE is named _PERSON_. I met 3 people named _PERSON_, the soap machine I used was ""_PERSON_ by _PERSON_"", and there's some lady named _PERSON_ running for public office. 9. You say pro-cess, we say prah-cess. 10. Beer (saving the only downside for last). You guys don't have the selection that most of the States has, and your beer is more expensive. Places like [this](_URL_ are not that uncommon in the states (especially the bigger towns/cities), and even the dive bars have 4-5 craft beers on tap (in addition to a wide selection in bottles). I will give you this - Labatt is much better than the average light, American beer, but I think we have you beat in terms of craft beer. **The People**Every. Damn. Person. In London was friendly as hell. I'm generally a friendly guy, and usually people around here get annoyed at how much I want to chat (at bars, on the street, on the bus, etc). It was awesome to have everyone be just as friendly (or friendlier). The guy who got me my first beer in London (at the Ale House on Dundas) went out of his way to shake my hand a week later when I was leaving down and he randomly saw me. The bouncer at _PERSON_' talked to me for 5 minutes about how he had never seen an ID from Kansas. One dude at _PERSON_'s bumped into me as I was leaving the washroom and insisted on buying me a beer and invited my whole group to sit at his table. I mean, we aren't all complete assholes in the US, but this is more friendly than I'm used to. **The Roads**Everyone speeds. I like this as well. **In conclusion**I need to come visit again.

angbq,45088,AskReddit,1263020966,"Ask Reddit Trial Lawyers:  I am in the process of being questioned to serve on a trial (voir dire). How do I get out of Jury Duty without lying?  And, have you ever sat on a Jury, Redditors?","_PERSON_I'm being questioned to be on a jury, What do I say (that isn't a lie) to get me out it? I'm not a scofflaw, I've already served time on three juries in my lifetime and I was the jury forewoman for all three cases.   It's mentally very tough.  It's tiring.  It can be gruesome.   When you are a juror, you know that someone's life is in your hands - it's serious business.  It weighs on your mind, it keeps you up at night.  You know you are not hearing the entire story because they keep so much out of the trial.  You have to hear very, very unpleasant things.  What has been seen cannot be unseen and all that.   I just don't want to go through it again.  I feel like I've done my duty as a citizen. I am in jury selection now.  I can't say what the trial is, only that it's a criminal matter.   I am IN the box and they started questioning me yesterday.  I have to go back on Monday to finish the questioning. These are the three trials I've done:Murder Trial  - about 5 weeks - guilty of _PERSON_ (We had an entire menu of verdicts to choose from.. from not guilty, all the way to 1st Deg. Murder)Robbery Trial - 1 week including jury selection - not guiltyChild _PERSON_, guilty as all mother fucking hell and I hope he is someone's butt boy in prison.When I was being questioned for the child molestation trial they asked me if I had anything to add at the end and I said something along the lines of,  ""I've sat on two juries and they were both very tough mentally and emotionally. While I could still follow the law, my strong preference is I be excused from service this time.""    The judge basically said, ""Well, Ms. _PERSON_, I understand you have a preference not to be on the jury, but we must make sacrifices for blah blah blah.. justice.. and blah blah blah.. and sometimes we have to do things we don't want to do."" Basically she said ""tough shit."" When the trial was over I asked the prosecutor, ""Why did you select me even after I said I didn't want to do it?""   She told me that she only has a few precious minutes to make a decision about a juror and that two other prosecutors had seen fit to put me on a jury and the fact that I'd been foreman for the two juries made me a very strong candidate. So.  Here I am AGAIN. In the box.  What are the odds??  And I will have to go back in on Monday and finish the questioning.   I honestly don't want to to jury duty again - but I also feel ethically obligated to tell the truth.  So I can't say something that has meant immediate dismissal for some of my fellow citizens:   ""Oh, well, they must be guilty if they have been charged""  or ""I don't feel I could be fair.""  I honestly don't want to lie to the court, but I have no other excuse other than I just don't want to do it again.   My employer pays my full salary for jury service so that's not even an issue."

qbawr,45088,LetsNotMeet,1330524681,Followed in [My] Car by Creepy man from the Store.,"I am a girl. Last year I went to the .99 cents store to pick up a couple of things on my lunch hour.  It's about 2 miles from where I work.   I was in line and there was this very tall man in an orange jumpsuit in line in front of me.  I've seen men around there in orange jumpsuits before - they are dock workers from the port nearby.    He said something and I didn't quite make it out so I just smiled and nodded.  He got out of line for a second, then came back to the line and stood behind me. _PERSON_ to be friendly, I said, ""You can have your place back in line..""  He just stood there staring at me and after a few minutes he whispered, ""mmmm.. damn, you beautiful. I want some of that."" It was that he whispered it in this nasty way. He said it in the most creepy way that the hair on the back of my neck stood up.   The .99 cents store is notorious for slow checkers so we were there for awhile and the whole time he just kept STARING at me and I got began to feel very uncomfortable  creeped out.  I should have just dropped my items and left, I don't know why I didn't.  That's what I'd do in the future.  I paid for my purchases and hightailed it around the back to the parking lot.  Got in my car and drove away.  About 3-4 blocks later I look in my rear view and notice that he *is behind me* and following me in a van.  A van, so cliche!  I immediately knew he was following me because I was driving away from the port, he should have gone the other way.   I tested my theory by making random turns and he made every turn with me.  I was in an industrial area without a lot of people around &amp; I was afraid to go back to work because I didn't want him to know where I work.   I decided that I'd drive to the nearest police station and while still driving, I was digging out my cell phone from my purse getting ready to call 911.Lo and behold I spotted a police car when I needed one!  I pulled up next to him at red light and motioned for him to roll down his window.  I told him quickly that the man in the van had been in a store with me and had been following every turn for about 10 minutes and I was terrified.  He said, ""ok, you keep going and I'll take care of him.""  Whew!!!So I kept going and in my rearview, I saw police officer pulled over the van on the block.   I was able to get back to work safely.  I'm sure nothing happened to the guy, he just got pulled over for a minute but I'd never been so glad to see a cop.I'm also glad that the guy got pulled over, so there is some record of who he is if some other woman gets raped or murdered or harassed in that area.  They'll know who it was or at least he'll be a suspect. This guy was incredibly creepy and I have no doubts that he had bad intentions for me.  I haven't been back to the .99 cents store since.  I dread running into that man again. Edit: Tiny Bit of grammar for _PERSON_"

I'm her best friend of 20 years and even I didn't know what kind of pain &amp; darkness she was dealing with.   Last night she told me that she came here one night when she was at her lowest point. She had a plan. She was ready. Her plan would not have resulted in a cry for help, it would have ended her life, no question.  It was the compassion &amp; understanding she received here that made her decide to get help instead of taking the quick way out.  Some wonderful person took her to a private conversation and spent a lot of time with her.  This is a direct quote from my friend, ""They reached in through the darkness and offered me a helping hand when I needed it most."" My friend is a kind person with a big heart and is well loved by me, her friends and her family.  I don't know what I would have done had she not found some help here.

I want to personally thank each and every one of you who volunteer your own time (and hearts) in order to make a difference for other human beings you don't even know.  It cannot be an easy thing to do. I want you to know that YOU make a difference.  This mattered.  YOU matter.Thank you from the bottom of my heart."

Also, questions inside.","On my drive from the Lake Merritt Area to Target in Emeryville yesterday I counted no less than 11 who were begging at stop lights.  There's always been someone at the 980 on ramp, but now they are on every corner around there and there's one at pretty much every single off ramp. I see a lot of young people in their 20's too, from a guy with slacks &amp; a button up shirt to crusty punks and everything in between.  And after seeing the same people at the same street corners for at least a year, this has obviously become their profession.  I don't want to support that. Ok, I admit I'm completely ignorant.  Are there no services for them?  Other than the offer of food if I have it, I don't give them money as I assume I'm just contributing to their next beer/dope/weed fix &amp; I work too hard to support their habits.   Am I wrong about that or do they really need food? I assume they know where to go for a meal so any advice I offer them wouldn't be appreciated. What, besides beer money WOULD be helpful? Last week I offered one woman an orange. She pushed it out of my hands onto the ground and said, ""I don't want your fucking orange, bitch.""  Well... OK..?  Did I commit some beggar faux pas &amp; is it insulting to offer food?"

How often? Are they theatre related or app related? How as your customer service experience been? I have been using [MoviePass](_URL_ for 3 months.  It's a great deal if you like to go to the movies and you see at least 3-4 movies a month.   So far I've seen at least 6 per month.  For the most part I like it as I get to see every single movie I want to see and don't have to decide what is ""worth"" seeing and what should be wait for video. However, a whole bunch of times now I've had issues where the app wouldn't take the reservation OR it took the reservation but the card wouldn't go through.   To me, it's totally humiliating if the card is declined so I always try to use the kiosk, but they don't have those at every theatre. At first I was standing in front of the theatre and calling customer service, but fuck that, I was tired of waiting on hold for 10 minutes in some cases and I didn't want to miss my movie or end up with shitty seats. _PERSON_ I don't even bother with calling, I just use my phone to take a pic of the ticket I paid for and send a refund request to the support email. So far have had no problem getting a refund, but it's kind of a pain and I have to keep checking my card to see if the refund shows up after 4-5 days.   A friend of mine who lives about 45 minutes away gets the same error when he and his GF to to one particular AMC theatre where the program is supposed to work.  They get the same error every single time.  They've been encountering the problem for months but it still hasn't been fixed.  They too have to pay cash &amp; get a refund every time they go to that theatre. For those of you who don't know, [MoviePass](_URL_ ) is a netflix-like subscription to movie theatres.  [Full Disclosure, that's my invite-link and you get a free month if 3 people sign up under you, but it's invite-only or ""wait for an invite when you sign up for one"" at this point.]   You need a smart phone, you can see 1 movie per day, can't see the same movie twice and it doesn't cover 3D or IMAX.

I recently put $14,000 on two credit cards to make some emergency home repairs.  Paying it back is no problem, I have excellent credit at 770+ and I'm re-financing the debt via SoFi to get a more reasonable rate than the credit cards.  If I choose a 36 month loan, should I pick the Fixed at 7.119% or Variable starting at 5.915% and could go as high as 9.99%. Do SoFI variable rates go up automatically or are they tied to the economy? I will probably end up paying $100-200 in extra payments each month, if that matters. Thank you for any advice."

When I wear a suit I tend to ditch my more hard use tools for something classier but overall I tend not to stray from the same gear day in and day out. On my person I have what I consider the perfect flashlight for me. It's an HDS Clicky170 and because I'm fond of orange, I bought an orange one. Since I started using this light, I haven't even bothered to look closely at new lights except toying with the idea of a headlamp for camping. I've used the same coin purse since I first arrived in the Philippines 5 years ago and now that I'm home in the US I haven't stopped using it. My keychain set-up hasn't changed for at least 3 years. Much to the chagrin of my wife, I haven't found the perfect knife yet. I thought I did with my Izula II but I found myself wanting a folding knife so I got my new _PERSON_ and it's been fantastic. Its only downside is that it doesn't have a pocket clip so it's not as easily accessible. What I'm getting at is that it's annoying to not feel complete. What are your perfect tools and how did you come bout about finding them?"

It consists of a camera, a computer with [removable hard drives](_URL_ and some dust masks.They pull out a [stack of books](_URL_ to work on for a day and take pictures of each of the [records](_URL_ When they finish with those recordbooks they go get some more from the many [(1)](_URL_ [(2)](_URL_ [(3)](_URL_ [(4)](_URL_ [(5)](_URL_ [(6)](_URL_ more available records.

He dropped them as he fled and my laptop was on the bottom so it broke the fall of my wife's. After that it wouldn't turn on because the AC power adapter built into the computer was busted. It was time to get a new one so we went to _PERSON_ and I picked up a new one, but I need the files off the old HD.The old HD is from a Dell Inspiron 15 from 2009 running Windows 7 with 500 GB. I have it hooked up through a SATA to USB 3 adapter to the new laptop, Dell Inspiron 15 running Windows 8.1 with 1TB.My first step was to simply open the HD in ""My Computer"" and copy/paste everything I needed onto the new HD but I kept seeing an error of ""incorrect parameters."" I then opened the command prompt and ran chkdsk on the old drive and it repaired a few things and said all was well. After this when I opened the HD to recover the files it came back with a fatal device hardware error. I ran chkdsk again and this time it told me there wasn't enough space to repair the Usn Journal $J data stream.This is where I'm lost as to what to do. Is anything recoverable on the old HD and if so, how would I go about doing it?"

I asked her to take it and she came out a [INFP](_URL_ which also describes her pretty well.  It was painful to read the analysis of the personality type because it was so accurate to what I have been going through:&gt; INTJs live much of their lives inside their own heads. They constantly scan their environment for new ideas and theories which they can turn into plans and structures. Sometimes, what they see and understand intuitively within themselves is more pure and ""perfect"" than the reality of a close personal relationship. INTJs may have a problem reconciling their reality with their fantasy.&gt; _PERSON_, the INTJ enjoys thinking about intimacy, and about ways to perfect it. In positive relationships, their creativity and intensity shine through in this arena. In more negative relationships, they might enjoy thinking about sex more than actually doing it. Her personality type is said to:&gt; _PERSON_, the INFP is likely to be initially slow to open up to their mates. Once their trust has been earned, the INFP will view sexual intimacy as an opportunity for expressing their deep-seated love and affection. More than the actual sexual act, they will value giving and receiving love and sweet words. With their tendency to enjoy serving others, they may value their mates satisfaction above their own.&gt; One real problem area for the INFP is their intensive dislike of conflict and criticism. The INFP is quick to find a personal angle in any critical comment, whether or not anything personal was intended. They will tend to take any sort of criticism as a personal attack on their character, and will usually become irrational and emotional in such situations. This can be a real problem for INFPs who are involved with persons who have Thinking and Judging preferences. ""TJ""s relate to others with a objective, decisive attitude that frequently shows an opinion on the topic of conversation. If the opinion is negative, the TJ's attitude may be threatening to the INFP, who will tend to respond emotionally to the negativity and be vaguely but emphatically convinced that the negativity is somehow the INFP's fault. Also fairly accurate, except for the eventually opening up part, as she has not been in touch with her own feelings, is not available emotionally, not really open to new ideas, and has never been sexually adventurous (and long uncomfortable with her own sexuality).I assume I am putting too much into the implied incompatibilities in this analysis but it is fairly accurate to what we have been going through (we recently started marriage therapy). Much of my problem is that I do live inside my own head so much and am continually fascinated with new ideas (sexually and in other areas, in which Reddit has only added fuel to all of this) and can not open up to her or share my feelings or desires with her.  I don't want to remain an introvert who lives inside my head fantasizing over things I can not fulfill and with a wife I cannot share these things with. I also have kids and don't really want to go through with a divorce which I have been contemplating the last year. Any advice on how to move forward?"

After a few of these talks my wife told me she wanted to buy our daughter a vibrator so she can get the benefits of masturbation and orgasms, and help her have control over her own sexuality. I think this is a good idea and read some articles recommending this for mothers of teen girls.  I know each person is different and may react differently, and am curious what you think about this idea and whether the benefits for our daughter outweigh the weirdness of having mom hand you a vibrator and encourage you to go for it.  Also, if you do think it is a good idea, what is a good first sex toy for a teenager with no sexual experience?**edit: To be clear, this would be between mother and daughter, I would not be involved. Also, part of why this came up is my wife was raised by parents that never discussed sexuality, was raised seeing sex and masturbation as bad, never masturbated regularly, never had an orgasm until years after we were together, and only in her 30's started to be comfortable with her sexuality.  The reason this came up is that during their talks, our daughter seemed comfortable discussing this with her mother but not very comfortable with her sexuality and she/we don't want to see her deal with the same issues in her life."

I am a MMJ patient and lucky to live in a state where I can grow legally.  I smoke regularly but not in big quantities.  I am looking to grow just enough for myself, with some left over to experiment with making hash and edibles, etc.  I know there is a lot out there to educate myself, but have a few quick questions I am hoping someone can help me out with.1. If it is for personal use, how many plants should I be looking at (again, I don't go through a lot weekly)?2. If it is just a couple of plants, is it realistic to be growing 1 Sativa and 1 Indica (as I prefer dominant sativas for the day and Indicas at night rather than blends) or do you need to stick to the same type of plant when just growing 2-4.3. Is it realistic to set up an affordable hydro system that if needed can be left alone for up to 8 days without causing damage when I need to occasionally go away (as there is no one I could trust to watch the plants when away).4. Do inexpensive carbon filter setups really work well enough to keep the scent to the plants as I can't fill my house, need to keep this my little secret. 5. Is it legal to order seeds online, again considering I am a legal MMJ patient, or do I need to stick with what I can buy at a local dispensary?6.

Neither of use had many sexual experiences before being married and our marriage as been monogamous as that's what I assumed it had to be. Our sex life started OK if a bit vanilla, and over the years my wife slipped back into shame, guilt and a background that discouraged openness. As we had kids, the sex slowed down, got more boring and I became very resentful. I was interested in more forms of pleasure than just p in v sex and the occasional blowjob.  It went on like this for a long time until a few years ago when I started listening to _PERSON_ podcast, which led to other podcasts and books which helped me realize that I was not alone in what I felt, in what I wanted and needed, and that it was OK for me feel that sex was important and that my needs were OK (which I previously felt petty and guilt to admit).  This led to trying to get my wife to open up and she did get more comfortable with sex, we had more of it, she stated letting me eat her out, use my fingers on her and she began to experience and enjoy lots of orgasms. She got very good at receiving pleasure (and I get off on giving it) but never made an effort to develop any skills at giving pleasure or doing the things I expressed as important to me. Over the last few years I have told her that I have always felt submissive and longing to act on this but she was not interested, I told her that I really wanted to be pegged and given prostate massages and she said OK but never went through with the pegging and 2 yrs later says she isn't ready, and while she stuck her finger in my ass she never took the time or read the articles I sent her on how to give a prostate massage. More recently I told her that while I was not romantically interested in or generally attracted to men I have always wanted to have sex with a man and this was part of who I was.  She was surprised but not upset and since she has recently expressed some interest in experiencing the joy of breasts saw this as not a big deal though offers no path to where I can experience this.  I have talked to her about threesomes (MFF and MMF) and while she is theoretically open she has such bad body image and shame that I don't see how she would ever go through with it. I know that the only path to me experiencing these things is to open our marriage. It is my preference to do this with her but am open to exploring on my own if that is what she prefers.  I understand and accept that any form of non monogamy would not work if she is coerced , forced or dragged into it which is why I have tried to get to take the baby steps to where she may open her mind and understand where I am coming from. She says she will, but doesn't. She won't listen to the podcasts I asked her to listen to, hasn't read Sex at Dawn which I was hoping would help her understand why I feel this way and nowhere ready to read Opening Up which I am halfway through. My question is this, if I have accepted that my sexuality is more complex than what she is willing to do and she isn't willing to fulfill my needs herself (and I would be willing to give up dreams of fulfilling my likely bisexuality if she was willing to peg me and top me a bit), and is not able to accept opening the marriage for reasons that are healthy (and not purely out of fear of losing me), than what option do I have other than to deny my sexuality and resign myself to a life of mediocre vanilla sex or to leave her which I really don'T want to do?TL;DR - I finally came out of sexual repression and accepted that I am bi &amp; sub - but am married to a woman who  says she understands I have needs yet hasn't been willing to do the things I have asked for and is too scared of non-monogamy to entertain the idea beyond theory.

She is opening up to it and I am nervous.","I have always fantasizes of being with a man but pushed it down as my romantic, and primary sexual attraction was with women.  I got married young and never explored my sexuality.  Over the last couple of years I came to terms with being bi.  It took many months but eventually I was able to tell this to my wife (thanks mojougrade). While she was surprised, she was not upset and had recently admitted to her own lite bi interests. She already knew I had some unmet kinks and she was always pretty vanilla. This led to me telling her that I really want sexual exploration and diversity and shared some of what I have read on couples exploring sex with others and that I really wanted this for us.  She is now opening up to the idea of a MMF threesome and giving me the ability, with her, to explore my same sex interests. Now that it is closer to a reality, I am getting a bit nervous.

Recently she has been opening up a lot and getting comfortable with sex and sexuality, in a large part due to my inability to keep bottling in my desires for more, having dealt with my own issues and concluding that I am kinky, submissive and bi and Ok with it, and have a need to explore sex (with her) beyond the basics.  I brought up the idea of a nude spa, in part for the adventure, and to help her overcome her body issues which is preventing her from considering threesomes as a reality.  She is ready for it and suggested we do it in August.  I have heard many accounts of this being a liberating experience. Ay experiences with this?Edit: I am not planning to have sex at the nudist spa (other than in our room) and understand it is not tolerant of public sexuality. We are going there to get comfortable with the idea of being nude in front of other people in a non sexual setting as this is less threatening to her than a swingers club or resort."

Edit: it's 3am and we are back in our bed.  We had a great time and lots of fantasies were fulfilled.  I lived up to my name and fulfilled some of my curiosities.

In part with the help and support of this community, I went from being close to leaving a sexually unfulfilling marriage a little more than a year ago, to just getting home from  a wild bisexual foursome and being closer than we ever were.","For many years my sexual interests and fantasies were completely apart from my reality.  I knew I was kinky, suspected that I was bisexual, and desired to be submissive.  My wife was helplessly vanilla, not open to sex beyond missionary penis in vagina and unable to communicate any fantasies or consider any change to our sex life.   Our communication sucked and we both shut down, grew bitter and resentful of one another.  Reddit was an outlet for me to complain and seek advice as I grew closer and closer to what seemed to be inevitable, divorce and breaking up a family.  Over the past few years I came to understand my desires and eventually accept them as part of me.  My inability to discuss my feelings with my wife and share that part of me ate at me and focused my energy on the negatives of our relationship.  In part from advice I received here, I realized the damage I was doing,  changed how I communicatated with her and forced myself to start opening up to her even thought it was dificult snd risky to do so.  She was shocked and her initial reactions and dropping of the conversations left me feeling very vulnerable and hopeless. Unable to understand the idea of sex apart from love, she saw it all as a threat.  Eventually, through lots of work, communication and getting her to start taking in other points of views, she started to come around and began sharing her own bi fantasies. This led to us exploring the idea of a 3some or 4some and after a bunch of hot talk we made a date with a couple.  That daye was tonight and we just got back from a night of firsts that had us both exploring bi play, all out foursome group sex sub play.  We had an amazing time, have no jealousy or guilt, and can't believe it really happened.  We are closer than ever and excited for our future together.  Tl:dr, sometimes it all works out, but it starts with communication.  Oh, and we had our first bi experiences and first new sexual partners in 20 yrs."

ndu17,13606,politics,1323961929,An email forwarded by a friend from the Directors Guild on their support (demand) for SOPA,"_PERSON_, President of the DGA:I recently returned from a whirlwind trip to Washington, D.C., together with First Vice President _PERSON_, National Executive Director _PERSON_ and Associate Executive Director for Government &amp; International Affairs _PERSON_, to lobby for the passage of essential legislation to fight foreign rogue websites that traffic in stolen content and counterfeit goods. We went to our nation’s capital as part of a concerted effort by the entertainment industry – guilds, unions, studios and networks – to press our case. And let me tell you, we are in for quite a fight.  Despite substantial bipartisan support in both houses of Congress (very unusual these days), this crucial legislation has been stalled by vociferous opposition from some of the world’s most powerful Internetcompanies – ‘Super Powers’ like Google, Yahoo and AOL who have significant financial stakes in making sure that these bills never become law. They are utilizing misinformation, disinformation and outright lies to manipulate the large and passionate base of Internet users they’ve developed over the years. Their playbook calls for igniting popular support by raising false concerns about this rogue sites legislation – accusing it of endangering Internet freedom, promoting censorship and violating the First Amendment. Nothing could be further from the truth. Of course, these are important concerns, and if they were at all valid, we would be the first to raise them. Alas, they are not. What’s most amazing is that the current rogue sites legislation before Congress is already ‘the law of the land’ in the United States.  This year, with the approval of federal judges, the Attorney General has taken down hundreds of U.S. sites selling illegal content, and guess what, the Internet has not broken and free speech has not crumbled. So why are these Internet ‘Super Powers’ so against this legislation? Because they are making huge profits from selling advertising on these foreign rogue sites – sites run by criminals who are selling stolen product – films and TV shows made by our members. Our request is simple. Foreign sites are currently beyond U.S. jurisdiction, and many U.S.-domiciled sites have moved offshore because the domestic enforcement program has been so successful. We desperately need legislation that will allow us to apply the same laws to foreign-based rogue sites that are already applied to domestic sites. That’s the message we carried in our D.C. meetings with senior officials at the White House including Vice President _PERSON_, Chief of Staff _PERSON_, National Economic Council Director _PERSON_ and Senior Advisor _PERSON_, as well as with numerous Senators and Congressmen. _PERSON_ said, “A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.” Well, our opponents have been telling plenty of lies and now it’s time to fight back. We need to put our shoes on fast, and mobilize to protect what is ours.

While you’re there, write a letter to your legislators – just click on Take Action.Send a video message to Congress: Record a short video on your smart phone, your computer or your video camera and send it to _EMAIL_’ll share your videos with Congress, with the media and on a dedicated YouTube channel to show that there are real people and real jobs at stake.E-mail us at _EMAIL_: We’ll add you to our email list so you’ll receive information and special opportunities to get involved, and we can answer any questions you may have as well.Support the DGA Political Action Committee: Help us support legislators who believe that the works you create are worthy of being protected.Tell your friends to get involved: The more people who take action, the stronger our collective voice will become.The bottom line – we support these bills and we won’t stop until effective legislation is passed.

o33p9,13606,bisexual,1325716870,On the defense of monogamy in r/bisexual and why I disgaree,"I agree that as a community, we need to stand up against bisexual stereotypes, and one of the more damaging ones is that bisexuals are less capable of having a long-term monogamous relationship.As we know, a bisexual man or woman can be just as sexually exclusive as someone who is straight, whether it is not acting on a desire for men when with a woman, or not acting on a thing for blondes when you are with a brunette. Where I differ with some here is in the defense of monogamy as the ideal in defending bisexuality. While I think that monogamy can be right for some to strive for or achieve, and believe that bisexuals can be just as good at it as straights; I think we should be honest in acknowledging  that humans are generally not so good at it as evidenced by divorce rates, cheating, and people living in passionless marriages.I think that perhaps the reason that bi's get pegged as being less monogamous than straights is that on average, bisexuals are likely to have a more sex positive worldview and be more open to other forms of relationships rather than accepting monogamy as the default or only valid form of relationship. I lived in a monogamous marriage for 20 years and experienced first hand how defining a relationship first and foremost by sexual exclusivity led to a marriage that was successful by that standard while failing at openness, honesty, happiness, bitterness and resentment.  In my experience, it was only after developing a sex positive attitude, accepting my wants and desires, and fully opening up to my spouse did we come closer together than ever before and have what is a truly successful marriage; ironically as we dropped the requirement of sexual exclusiveness. Having sex with other people (together as a couple) made us happier, more fulfilled and brought us closer together. I am not saying to not be monogamous, I am advocating that you stop and consider why you want to be monogamous and make a decision to do so after considering the other options and accepting that while bisexuals are not any less capable of monogamy than straights, few of us are good at it given enough time.tl;dr: my wife and I gave up monogamy as the defining ideal of our marriage, and are way better at marriage and closer than ever."

We play outside the home, are making friends and no reason to say anything to the kids though they likely know something is different (in a positive way for us).The question is, it took so long to find this alternative to monogamy that I want my kids to know there are alternatives of settling down with one person and only one person forever. I would like to encourage them to explore their options and not assume there is only one model for a successful relationship, but doing so would raise questions about our marriage which I am not prepared to answer.Any thoughts or experiences with this?"

We are not looking for other romantic relationships as a couple or individually which is the defining characteristic of polyamory (many loves). I have no problem with polyamory but neither of us feel it is right for us.

We have had a couple of foursomes,a threesome, and are getting close with another bi couple as friends and sex partners for group experiences.  We like them and have a connection as friends, but don't plan to tell them how much we love them or have them move in with us.

Things were bleak and my sexually repressed wife showed no signs she would open up, yet ever be at a place where i could discuss any of my secret desires with her.  It took years and close to divorce before I got the nerve to open and up and share it all with her.  It was scary, awkward and went months of the conversation going nowhere, like it never happened.  Then a friend explained, that I made it all about me, my desires, my needs, my frustrations.  I began to empathize with her more and kept pressing the communication but in different terms.  She agreed to read erotica, listen to some sex positive podcast I recommended and read Sex at Dawn.   She began opening up, getting in touch with her own repressed desires and started to become as intrigued as I was with exploring sex with others as a couple.  My sex negative wife who never had a fantasy and barely communicated evolved into the wife I always wanted.  Opening up, yes communication, radical honest communication - while scary Led to us being closer than ever and more in love than I could recall in 20 years of marriage.  We just got home from a 'date' with another couple, whom we spent more than seven hours having sex it last night in every combination and lots of firsts for all of us. It was tremendously liberating and and an amazing experience and made possible only through communication.  I know I got lucky and to everyone will open as my wife did, but want to let you know that I never thought is was possible for me and hope this encourages positive communication ad a better understanding of where your partner is when it's hard t get past your own frustrations."

royqx,13606,polyamory,1333335858,"Couple, new to non-monogamy, question on labels and relationship styles","After 20 years of monogamy with little sexual experience before being together, my wife and I decided to pursue new sexual experiences together as a couple. We were both interested in same sex/bi and group experiences. We decided to do this as a couple, meeting with other bi/open couples.  We went the swinger route as we weren't looking for other romantic relationships, but for friends we can have sex with (FWB's).We met with a few couples, 2 turned out to be one night thing, didn't click. A third we began to get close to, but didn't work out.  We have had enough experiences to know that we don't want to sleep with people we don't know or that we don't like. We want to form a level of intimacy with them, get to know hem well, be close, someone we would want to spend time with even if we weren't having sex with them. We are also looking for the couple to be bi/sexually open as we are. Our ideal is to have 2-4 couples we are close with as friends and may play with, not to be exclusive with another couple as a quad.We are finding that this is not so easy in the swinger community where there are few bi men (but way more than admit to it in profiles), many are into the pursuit of casual sex (and clubs which isn't our thing) and not looking for long term friendships/relationships, and too many of them are people we wouldn't get along with (conservative, religious, and generally vanilla - where I am a liberal, vegan, non-sports following, kinky, NPR listener).  There are some couples in the swinger community we may connect with, but the numbers are limited (and that doesn't touch on the added complexity of geography or physical attraction). The question is, is the intimacy we are looking for as friends and lovers, mean that we should be exploring the poly and not the singer community? Or does our desire to date and play as a couple with other couples, and seeing the relationship more as close friends than romantic partners, put us too far from the poly community?"

sf4pk,13606,bisexual,1334708479,Bisexuality and male bonding,"I always had an interest in sex with men, though not often an attraction to men. This took a back seat to my primary interest in women and I denied that part of myself, having lots of shame and guilt over the same sex feelings and desires I had and never explored (in part because I met the women I would marry shortly after becoming sexually active). When I finally came to terms with and accepted my bisexuality (along with other, unrelated sexual interests that were also denied and unsuccessfully suppressed) I wondered if this was the source of the problems I have had relating to men. I never had close male friends since high school, tend not to relate to men well, was never much into sports and couldn't stand the bro-mentality or small talk.  I have suspected that I put up a wall in dealing with men, in part to prevent any sexual feelings or desires from developing or tempting me; helping push me into introversion and not connecting well with most people (I tend to do better with women, and ironically with gay men). Now that I have accepted myself, shared it all with my wife, and even got to act on some sexual experiences with men (with her); I still have a desire to overcome my issues in relating to other men and am realizing that what I want is a sexual friendship with a man, that I am missing the physical closeness to augment what I have. I have not and will not act on this unless it is something that my wife supports - and I assume I will get downvoted for playing into negative bi stereotypes though I had been * successfully* monogamous for over 20 years.Was wondering if anyone else here had similar challenges in forming bonds with men (sexual or not) from years of repressing their true self?"
sf5by,13606,lgbt,1334709178,Bisexual guy surprised to discover that he is attracted to lesbians,"I thought of posting this after reading a post from a woman here talking of all the straight males that hit on her. I haven't and wouldn't do this but was wondering why I consistently am attracted to gay women - and it isn't in a 'girl-on-girl, that's hot' kind of way. In the last year I accepted that I was bi and came out to my wife with a desire for new sexual experiences with her. She admitted she had longed to play with women and we decided to pursue bi couples together. We met a few couples through swinger websites and had a few great experiences but found that the swinger community wasn't a great fit for us as we were looking for more intimate friendships rather than casual sex, and that they are generally not so big on bi men.  I got advice to look at the poly community and my wife and I created profiles on OKCupid and I set my profile to be contacted only by bi/gay people. When I log onto my wife's profile (she isn't big in online dating and leaves the work to me) she keeps getting matched to gay women whose 'match' percentage are 90+% high to my profile, and come across as so smart, confident and sexy, much more attractive to me than the women (or men) I am getting matched to. Since they are not looking for men, I am not contacting them. Since my wife is looking only with me (and primarily for M/F couples) she is not contacting them.  I am just surprised that as a newly bisexual man I seem to consistently be attracted to people who would have no interest in me (or my wife with me)."

We went the swinger route (swinger websites, not clubs/parties), met with a few couples and enjoyed the experiences.  We did find that it was harder to meet M/F couples where both were bi and that the swinger crowd tended to prefer straight sex, swapping and casual sex where we were looking for a connection with like-minded (liberal) couples as friends and lovers.  I had listened to a bunch of poly podcasts and read Opening Up and The Etchical Slut, and while I was attracted to many elements of polyamory and believe I have moved past jealousy, managing multiple relationships as an individual seems complicated and I do see myself staying with my wife as a primary relationship.  My wife has an open kind and enjoys the foursome play but is nowhere as kinky as me or has the sexual appetite that I do and still has significant jealousy issues at the thought of me having a relationship as an individual (or with individuals) and is it interested in this for herself, she does want to pursue relationships as a couple with their open-minded couples.  I am fine with this but see it as more difficult for me to find what I am looking for in this arrangement as I am interested in the type of sex I don't have with her which is more conventional.  I see us as somewhere between swinger and poly, and there seems to be a trend of many in the swinger lifestyle heading to this direction, though still a minority of swingers (as most seem to enjoy the hunt of casual sex or see keeping it as casual as a way not to threaten the primary relationship), add to that we only interested in couples where both are bi, and not interested in religious or conservative folks - I'm not sure how many couples there are for us amongst the swingers.  The question is, do we belong in the ply community and how typical is it for ply couples to date and for, relationships as a couple wit other couples?  Our interest is in making deep intamate friendships/relationships. This isn't necessarily poly fidelity as we aren't looking to be exclusive but to form a small group of couples, though we would be open to it with the right couple.

We went the swinger route almost a year ago and had a few fun experiences but found we don't connect with the party/club scene and much of that community given the prevalence of more conservative politics and attitudes on sex as I am a bi male with an interest in kink. We looked at polyamory and it has great appeal to me, we both enjoy the poly community, but my wife is concerned with me forming other relationships and doesn't desire one for  herself.  I understand this and get that not everyone is wired for polyamory.  She is into the idea of us playing with other committed couples (oral, touching, no penetration) and is opening to threesomes with limits on which sexual acts we share with others and what we don't. While I appreciate the openness after 20 years of monogamy (during which I repressed my bisexuality and interest in non-vanilla sex) I find it odd that with all these concerns and limitations, she has been open to and encouraging me to see a man, on my own, to fully explore my bisexuality for the first time.        This is happening tonight and I'm quite nervous but that's another story. I was wondering if any other non-monogamous bisexuals here have experienced this where their SO is open to you being with one gender while totally against the same with another. I get that my wife sees other women as a threat and men less so, but to my bi brain I don't see the same distinction as both could potentially be a threat while I know that neither is as I am committed to her."

After some deliberation we decided to open up and had several great experiences with others (more swinger than poly) and with further exploration came to understand that I am not wired for or desirous of monogamy (though I have never cheated).  While she had enjoyed these experiences (perhaps more than myself), she shut down and closed up after realizing that this wasn't some short term experiment but something I desired, needed as part of my life.  She had been a a poor communicator which was a problem that got better when we opened up and returned when she closed up. While she had agreed to friendships and sex wither others, together as a couple, she hasn't followed through with this and is threatened by the idea of being open despite being exposed to lots of information on polyamory and meeting many poly people in successful relationships. I can't stand the thought of losing her, nor can I return to monogamy with too many needs that are unmet and a strong desire for a connection with other people and new sexual experiences (it's not just about the sex, but is a lot about the sex). I have a strong sense of aging and want to enjoy life now, frustrated at waiting for her to work out her issues without the benefit of communication (or leveraging available resources such as books, counselors, community, etc).  I see clearly that to love someone is to want them to be happy and fulfilled, and would do anything for her, but her love of me isn't met by actions.  While I try to see this from her side, and get that non-monogamy can be threatening, we have already taken that step and had great experiences doing so, making it difficult for me to continue to be patient while I am missing so many opportunities and struggling with a need to live more true to myself. I appreciate any advice on how to deal with a spouse who has cracked the door open to non-monogmy but resisting it to happen. Edit: update, she came home last night having thought things over and is open and committed to us exploring relationships (friendships, not romantic partners) with others (couples, single men and women) provided we do it together.  While I would like the flexibility to see people we know and she is comfortable with on my own, this makes me happy and should provide for the experiences and additional connections I am looking for. she acknowledged that there was some resistance to the added work and time required to make this work as well as some body issues that went beyond what I realized that has prevented her from opening up more to others though she acknowledged that she really enjoyed the experiences with others weave had. So, great news and thanks for the advice."

16i5fd,13606,bisexual,1358104845,"Not so bi, or held back by shame?","I have always been interested in being with a man. It was more of an obsession or fetish for cock and not the man himself as I have read about here so many times. There are times I have had crushes on men or been turned on by a guy but not so often with a powerful attraction to women. The interest in being sexual with a man didn't go away, it got stronger over the years and I finally came to terms with it. Accepting that I wanted this, that it is part of me, that it didn't make me straight but that I was not totally straight. I embraced the identity of bisexual and was ok with it, coming out to my wife, telling some friends and family and having a couple of sexual experiences with a man - which were ok (there wasn't much chemistry with the guys I was with). In one of those experiences I did find myself caught in the moment pursuing and enjoying more intimate body contact then I had expected and even kissing which I never thought I would do and enjoyed it.  So with all this said, I still get cold feet at the idea of being with a guy. I am nervous about it. I am far more drawn to women.  The idea of sex with a guy is so hot in my head but subject to the harsh light of day leaves me feeling odd, uncomfortable watching gay or bi porn (though I've never been a big porn person, preferring erotica). I am in play situations where the opportunity to be with a guy is present and I shy away from it. I have spoken to people online about sexual situations we may get into and when I meet them can't see myself doing it.  Being the analytical person I am, I assume this just be lingering shame and repression from all those years of confusion preventing me from embracing he opportunity to explore this fantasy, but part of me wonders if maybe it is fantasy or if I am more sexually curious than truly bi. There is a guy I've been talking to for quite a while who I am likely to get together with, just the two of us; where I will find out how it feels to fully explore sex with a man.  I am a bit intimidated by the thought, apprehensive, but really wanting to find out once and for all where I stand.  Thoughts?"

197umt,13606,bisexual,1361830321,"I am unashamedly bisexual and non-monogamous, and for me the two are linked...","I am bisexual and non-monogamous; not the cheating kind of non-monogamy but the ethical kind that involves lots of self-work, honesty, respect for my spouse, great communication, and a loving commitment (yes, we are committed to one another and non-monogamous, these are not mutually exclusive concepts). For those who are bisexual and desire nothing more than a monogamous commitment, I feel your pain. I understand how much negative stereotypes hurt, after-all being non-monogamous and bisexual I face them too, and from all sides. I do not think that non-monogamy is for everyone, and I don't believe that bisexuals are by nature any less monogamous than mono-sexuals, actually I think that for the majority of all people monogamy is difficult.My bisexuality and non-monogamy are linked, because after a lifetime of living with shame, of repressing who I was sexually, and living my life to what others expected me to be, I finally cracked and came out the other side a better person embracing the reality that I am bisexual, kinky, and needing a deep intimate connections and sexual variety with more than one person. It was a terrible struggle to then tell these things to my wife who saw me as the vanilla, conventional person I lived my life trying to be - and was shocked by this revelation. This led her to a lot of thinking, an attempt to understand how I could say these things and still love her and want to be with her, and better understand her own repressed desires. After some months, she realized that she was also curious as to what was out there, about her own sexuality, and desirous of new experiences and we set out to better understand our wants and needs, our boundaries and have grown together as we seek out new experiences and relationships, in our case shared as a couple.While negative stereotypes do suck, the reality is that a higher percentage of bisexuals are ethically non-monogamous than monosexuals (I can't quote a source but this has certainly been my experience as the majority of men and women in the poly community I have met are bisexual). While there is a correlation between the two for many, I do not believe that their bisexualty causes anyone to be any less monogamous, and that bisexuals are just as capable of a lifelong monogamous commitment as a monosexual person; though in general we all, regardless of our sexuality suck at monogamy given enough time (as evidenced by rates of cheating, misery and divorce). The linkage is not in an inability to be monogamous as much as it has to do with what it means to be honest with yourself about who you are sexually and what you need to be happy. When one confronts societal pressures to conform and stands up to proclaim themselves to be other than straight - it is a big deal and difficult to do. When one takes that giant step and throws off conformity in one aspect of their life to embrace who they are sexually, it is far more likely that they would examine other areas of their life where they may feel pressure to conform; hence a likely higher correlation of bisexuality and atheism, bisexuality and vegetarianism, and bisexuality and non-monogamy (for the record, I am all of these things). My non-monogamy does not affect your monogamy; that bigots may assume you aren't capable of non-monogamy is the fault of the bigots and not mine. I am just trying to live my life without shame.I would like to add that I had a monogamous commitment with my wife for more than 20 years before arriving at non-monogamy. I was successful at monogamy, I didn't cheat, I didn't kiss another woman (or man), and neither did she. We did it perfectly and we were miserable for many of those years; sexually unsatisfied, not honest about our needs and desires, and almost divorced as a result before opening up about who we really are - a trait which should be held as more important than sexual exclusivity in defining a successful relationship. I would further add that many of the people (bi, straight or gay) upset about people being non-monogamous have not made a successful long term commitment to monogamy, instead practicing serial monogamy, being exclusive to ne person months or a few years at a time - a very different thing than being exclusive to one person for a lifetime commitment. I can tell you that in my first five years of marriage I would not have understood how one can be committed and non-monogamous and likely couldn't of transitioned our relationship successfully, but after being truly monogamous ones perspective may change as they understand that love is about more than being sexually exclusive and that people grow and needs change over time.As far as the unashamedly part, it isn't totally true as I still have shame - more so about being bi than being poly - and am working to get over it.  Feeling like some would want to exclude me from fully participating in the bi community for reinforcing a stereotype doesn't help with the loss of shame."

There is tremendous diversity in sexual fantasies, tastes and practices.  There are no rigidly defined gender traits, just as gender does not follow a strict binary and neither does sexuality or sexual attraction.  It is all odd and wonderful and more diverse than most of us imagine.  We are into what we are into.  There will always be others who feel the same, and others who do not. I have also found that when we are into something that is a bit up of the mainstream, there are always others who share that interest -and the beauty of the Internet is that you can find them.  I have also found that just because someone doesn't share your interest, doesn't mean that they can't discover that they enjoy it through your enjoyment. This has been the case for me as I struggled for years over the things I want, I didn't consider to be 'normal' and assumed would not be accepted by my SO. After finally sharing them, she opened her mind, discovered the pleasure I recieved and now my kinks are hers and I found that normal is meaningless and self-acceptance and openness can lead to  fulfillment and enjoyment.  While It is comforting to know we are not alone; when it comes to sex little, if anything is truly normal or abnormal.Tl:dr; when it comes to sex and sexuality, none of it is normal, and none of it is abnormal. It's just who we are, and how we are wired; and the sooner we can get over concerns of whether it's normal, and just accept it as part of who we are- the sooner we can find joy and fulfillment with others who who share our sexual interests or discover they can once they are shared.  You get one shot at this, stop worrying and enjoy it."

Once she did, she did a lot more and realized that her sexuality was far more fluid than she had realized. After 20 years of repressing my same sex feelings while married to a woman I didn't think I could ever share this with, being openly bi and married to a bi woman is so much better and I never would have got there if I didn't say the things that scared me."
1za6lu,13606,bisexual,1393699733,PSA (pan*sexual*accuracy),"I saw this on a Tumblr blog titled [bisexualsaregreat](_URL_ and found it to capture an issue I have had with how pansexual is often used in relation to bisexuality:&gt;Pansexuals, please stop relying on ANY definition of bisexual to explain your own identity. It’s unnecessary and harmful.&gt;There is a valid difference between bisexual and pansexual. _PERSON_ are attracted to same and different genders, and pansexuals are attracted to all genders, or regardless of gender.&gt;By asserting that “bi = 2” or “bi = cis man and cis woman” you are alienating yourselves from the bi community, which has not only been historically allied with the trans* community, but also works actively to be inclusive of other non-monosexual identities. &gt;Both bi and pan people are attracted to more than one gender and are equally harmed by monosexism. It’s time to put the bi vs. pan debate to bed, once and for all."

This hasn't been a problem, though they have had other partners where the pheromones were magical and the sex was like a drug. These relationships hadn't lasted, but there is a new partner where this exists and it is highlighting the contrast to our enjoyable but non-drug-like sex. I am concerned that with this other partner in their life, it will make the sex we have less enjoyable and the relationship phased out, and am curious what others have experienced between different concurrent relationships."

Our play has never involved much DS, instead has been lots of sensation from mild to edge, some orgasm control, mindfuckery, but not based on protocols outside of a scene and little within it. I am playing this weekend with a regular play partner. We never had a DS component and are planning on one for this weekend as we are going to a more protocol heavy play environment (and she is into it). She asked about protocols and I am looking for good resources to better understand what I may want to look at beyond how I am addressed and what she is to wear. I also had a question about introducing a collar to the scene would be appropriate or whether that may be imply some kind of commitment of ownership or submission outside of the scene which is not what I am looking for."
27su5n,13606,genderqueer,1402420384,"Unsure of whether I ""qualify"" as _PERSON_","I am debating how I related to gender and would like your feedback. I was an emotional little boy who was told repeatedly that boys don't cry, how to act like a man, and I did. I turned off emotion, never expressed vulnerability, didn't let anyone in who may see my gender non-conforming thoughts. I knew I had sexual interests that deviated from these masculine expectations, bisexuality, kink and a desire to submit. I was shamed by this and repressed it as best I could and lived and appeared undeniably masculine. It wasn't until my late 30's that I opened up to the realities of sex, sexuality, gender and relationships and accepted that I was bi, that I had non-conforming kinks, that I liked anal play and had a sexuality that transcended my penis as a sole source of pleasure. Once I broke from this need to conform to a heterosexual masculine social construct I allowed myself to become vulnerable, express emotion, simply to be myself and be less concerned with how I *should* act. So my question is, does rejecting a gender binary make me genderqueer if I haven't changed how I present myself? As a cis-male in my 40's, married to a woman, kids, suburbs, I feel like a fraud to identify as other than male; though I reject the premise of what ""male"" is preferring to be myself. I am socializing more in a sex-positive world and enjoying the opportunity to be open about and experience my bisexual, kinky, and polyamorous sides and as I meet more people who identify outside of the gender binary it is unclear to me where I belong in terms of gender. tl:dr: If I present myself as male, am fine with being a man but reject the social construct of what it means to be a man and embrace feminine traits does this make me genderqueer or just an open minded man who has transcended the imposition of a masculinity defined by others?Thoughts?"

2fi73e,13606,bisexual,1409875650,Bisexual v. Queer identity,"I generally identify as bisexual though I still haven't had the experiences to fully understand the depth of my attraction to men sexually or romantically (I am male). On dating sites like OKC I identify as bi, though on sites where there are more nuanced options (like Fetlife) I identify as heteroflexible which may more accurately describe my attraction as bisexual and hetero-romantic. A friend recently challenged me on this, questioning how many times do I need my ticket punched before I fully embrace a bi identity. Lately I have been questioning an identity as queer as in addition to an interest in more than one gender, I am very involved in the BDSM/kink scene and am primarily interested in kinky and non-normative sex (in which I am a submissive leaning switch), I am polyamorous, and generally have a lack of interest in conforming to what is traditionally male.  I find that I am near exclusively attracted to bi and queer identified people and see a queer identity as speaking to a broader range of my sexuality than the gender I want to sleeps with. My hesitation in adopting a _PERSON_ identity is the potential assumption that I am mostly interested in same-sex partners (which is not currently the case), the other contributing to bi-erasure. I was wondering what the people of /r/bisexual think about identifying as _PERSON_, particularly those who embraced this identity or considered it deciding firmly on identifying as bisexual."

dmbmj,22829,AskReddit,1286139283,Hard time Coping and Needing advice,"Every side has its story and this is my side of the story and what I knew at the time.  What I will say I say in complete honesty as I have done for all of this to anyone who has asked because I have nothing to hide.  I also will post a blog which I had discovered while trying to get rid of ANYTHING that reminded me of her...but sadly that is hard.I met this girl who I will just refer to as Carol, of course not her real name.  _PERSON_...we had been friends since last year of around this time frame.  This woman was married and is now (which we will later get into) and has 2 kids.  Slowly over time, despite us being friends and shooting the shit about random things at all sorts of hours of the night - because we were both night owls and she was 3 hours away from where i lived...her being a mother and me being a ""pull an all nighter"" college student.  I had gone to several club-parties and had met her at one of them and she was extremely excited to meet me, all over me and etc.  She had told me her husband didnt care...which as a naive, never dated many girls, respectful kind of guy..it struck me as odd and i felt uncomfortable but she was a good friend of mine.  So after that we became closer friends and talked more frequently.  I began developing emotions for her which I knew where not right, so I never told her.  She on the other hand did grow emotions and was telling me.  There had been this one club-party which she went to as her husband had went out of town prior to another one and she went against his wishes because of what he did and because she wanted to go out.  It was apparent that things weren't going right in their relationship and I never once had attempted to do anything to ruin it.  Come new years, we rented a hotel in another city to go and enjoy this huge club-party which we both had an extremely great time at, at this point she made it clear she had obvious emotions and it was hard to hide them...i am guilty of it to.  We had sex that night...she showed a strong want for this and i was seduced into it, but of  course it takes two to tango.  After that she went back to her place...and her husband went to try and have sex with her and she showed no emotions because of the fights they had  and how it all ended up (her husband had some kind of fascination with swinging).  fast forward a week later, she calls me saying she got kicked out and what not and is sleeping in her car.  I felt bad as a friend...i know, thats where it gets weird...and told her that the offer is there if she needed it and since she was 3 hours away it was just an offer...she could stay at my place ...for a couple of days....These couple of days I basically treated her and showed her around town where we had a lot of fun and it felt amazing because I never had much luck with women and to just have a friend with me that was a girl and it appearing as if we are together...hell it made me look good.  This girl was real good looking for a guy like me to have around him it was...unique. _PERSON_ couple of days that she stayed caused her emotions to switch which I had no intentions of....and that is where it resulted in her moving in with me in which we had lived together for nearly 10 months in two diff apartments(the second one which we got no more than 2-3 months ago and signed a lease together).  So over time I kept asking her what had happened and what went wrong and etc.  She would tell me these things that I believed because there could be no reason why she got kicked out because she appeared to be such a nice woman, right?  I was blinded and fooled.  Well basically at this point we are living together and her kids are in a better place where they have a much higher quality of living so I was happy for her kids at least.  At first she would cook and clean for me when i asked her not to because she was MY guest but it had slowly grown on me over time.  At this point we might as well say we were together and so we were.  Here she is separated because of what I assumed was her marriage going downhill either way, as she had told me.  Over the period of 8 months or so we had our arguments, some bad, some really bad, some not so bad, etc.  She had no job for a decent while, while i was paying my half of the rent and my roommate was doing the same and her not paying anything.  I eventually told her she needs to get a job and so she did..at a restaurant..which she got fired from because of some ""small mistake"" that caused an ""asshole manager"" to fire her.  When my parents knew her story, they still accepted her as a daughter...that is how close of a family bond me and my family have and that is how we are...we care for people.  What I knew about her, my parents knew.  My parents had done quite a bit for her as did I.  Whenever we had these fights, this girl would hold grudges against me...even for fights that would have happened 3-4 months ago.  She dwelled on so much shit and yet stated she didnt...yeah.  _PERSON_...2 weeks ago we got into an argument where she said i was a negative person and it started making me doubt myself...that is how much of an impact she had on me.  I told her I would change..no one should have to change for anyone...but adapt.  I told her I would change and I did so....she caused me so much grief that it helped me get d's on 3 of my exams...because she gave me so much emotional stress.  _PERSON_, after this fight I met up with some old high school friends that i continued to remain friends with and I told them the story.  I am not one to try and manipulate people into choosing my side...so I tried to say things like ""maybe i was wrong""(doubt) and etc.  I now feel manipulated because of this very reason.  This was on the 2nd of this month...mind you at 2pm we had lunch together as if everything was fine.  I had paid for it.  I got home around 3am from this party because she wanted me to stop by the store...after sending me pics of her smiling and what not about trying to coerce me into going to the store to get her some milk and something sweet...which I had done.  She was asleep by the time I got home and something told me ""You need to check her facebook mailbox because she has gone through your text messages and facebook and everything, this is the opportunity to see what SHE is doing while you are gone.""  It turns out, she had messaged someone else from the same area and had stated, ""We have decided we are going to try and work things out again.""  This message was sent @ 8pm.  I wasnt at home during this hour because I was at work.  So as soon as I found out I told her to ""wake the fuck up right now"" and I asked her what the hell this message was.  She was caught....so she was obviously defensive.  Needless to say I was so livid that I told her ""You are a piece of shit for doing what you did"" and ""You are fucking dead to me"" and etc.  What she did and what I had done for her and what my folks had done for her was out the window and not once appreciated and it was a huge snowball effect of all sorts of things that caused me to explode.  I finished by telling her ""You do not deserve to say a fucking word to me.  I want your god damn shit out by the morning.""  Some people say that I should have woke her ass up and told her to get the fuck out right then and there.  Before she left...I saw her Facebook messages and she deleted the one that I had mentioned....I wonder why?In the end...its hard going to an apartment that you shared with someone and whom you had entrusted them to not do anything even after asking them ""Is there anything that I need to worry about before signing this lease?"" because this apartment is costing me 80-85% of my income per month now.  I cannot get out of it and if I do I have to pay a percentage...a percentage that I do not even have to pay.  I feel so manipulated and deceived and lied to.  My trust for anyone else is out the window.  This is not only going to affect me in the long run, its going to be unfair to the person whom I would date.  I can no longer trust another woman because of seeing how evil and psychotic they can be.  This woman had manipulated shit like saying that my mom had told her to forget about her kids.  I discovered yesterday AFTER the fact that my mother did not say this but she had stated how the situation was for this girl and had said ""You have several options, but you need to figure out what YOU want.  You can go back and get your kids, or at least hope you can since they have been with someone else for ~8 months and try and stick it through or you can leave them alone with the new family...which is a sister in-law's whom is moving out of state.  I have a strong feeling that this girl will not get her children back.  I hope she does not for the mere fact that I find her to be mentally unstable for such a duty.  I dont know how to handle this and this was my first real big relationship which went past a 3 month time frame.  Redditer's and Redditettes...I need you because Ive been feeling so down and lonely and so hurt and emotionally scarred.  I have been on here many times and have commented on things several times.  I respect anyones opinions at this point and I know im going to be told at least one thing that resembles ""You are a fool"" and etc.  I will admit...I should have seen this for the first time.Here is a blog that she had written which I found in my email account after getting rid of everything that has her involved, but that is hard to do so I am not ready for that right now.---------------------------------------------------------------""There once was a man whom we will call _PERSON_.  _PERSON_ is 26 years old.  He had fathered two children (who are now in the hands of family) and was once married to a hateful evil bitch whom he loved more than anything.  However, after a 6-month span of casual sex outside of marriage, his wife decided that she didn't want to be with _PERSON_ anymore.  _PERSON_ finally got tired of the way she would openly cheat on him so much that he finally kicked her out (which is really what she wanted anyway).Now that his wife was gone and his two children were under better care of others, _PERSON_ was left lonely and confused.  His home was now a shell of what it once was as it was full of memories of a life that was over.  To combat his feelings of loneliness, _PERSON_ allowed one of his friends to move in with him.  This friend, whom we shall call _PERSON_, was a girl.  A month before, when _PERSON_ met _PERSON_, he was instantly attracted to her.  She was fun-loving, carefree, and new how to dance.  He went to the clubs with her a couple of times and then even took her on a trip to another city so that he could spend some time getting to know her on a more personal level.  However, the day following his return from the trip, he split with his wife.  The next day he told _PERSON_ that she could come live with him as she had no place to go. This decision, which will later prove to be a good one, did not go without consequence.  His ex-wife found out and began telling his family and friends that he replaced her with another girl.  Although this might have actually been what _PERSON_ was attempting, it did not work out that way.  At that point, simply to defend his honor, he was forced to tell everyone that their relationship was strictly plutonic.  He also realized at this point that he had to let go of his attraction to _PERSON_ simply because he prided himself as being a man of his word.  It should be known that _PERSON_ never showed any signs of being attracted in return.  _PERSON_ as he was about his swinger ex-wife and the fact that he was now alone led him to make rash decisions regarding his personal feelings.  After he realized that their relationship would be nothing more than roommates, his feelings towards her diminished. _PERSON_ feelings would later be replaced by a very close friendship.  Instead of feeling attracted to her, _PERSON_ became protective of her.  It may have been the fact that he was used to taking care of a family, or it may have been the fact that _PERSON_ was young, but _PERSON_ felt the need to take care of her.  It was entirely possible that he felt like he was doing something good for someone in need.A month passed and his feelings of lonliness grew each day.  He became more withdrawn and secluded himself to his bedroom to play video games, watch TV, or find some other way to pass his time alone.  _PERSON_ became aware of his isolation and began to wonder why.  _PERSON_ merely explained that he was just tired and his bed was really comfortable (which it was).  _PERSON_ missed his wife and children.  He was the one who kicked her out but each day he regret his decision a little bit more.  Then his ex-wife came into town to visit.  She claimed that she was coming into town to visit her children.  However, she got into town on a Friday night and she wasnt going to be visiting her children until Sunday.  _PERSON_'s confusion at this point grew exponentially.  She came and stayed with him and he asked her to come home and be his wife again.  She declined his offer.  This only added to his confusion.  If she did not want to be with him, why was she staying at his place for two nights when she could have driven into town and visited the children before returning home.  Although she had chosen not to remain his wife, he took advantage of the weekend to enjoy his last few days with his ex.  He took her out to dinner, he took her out to a dance club, and even bought things for her that she wanted.  After the trip to the club on Saturday he left the bedroom only to hear her on the phone with her new boyfriend.  She spoke to him in a kind, caring, loving voice that _PERSON_ had not heard in quite some time.  Hearing this only caused _PERSON_ more pain and he decided at that point to end their relationship altogether.  He was going to have to deal with his feelings about her on his own.  He severed all contact with her, leaving her with only a myspace blog to explain his feelings.  In retrospect, _PERSON_ realized that the reason for her stay at his place that weekend was only to get money from him.  This made him very angry and helped to alleviate the pain he felt.  He became extremely bitter and resentful toward her and to _PERSON_, it felt really good.With a renewed sense of self-esteem and purpose, _PERSON_ finally began the process of rebuilding his life.  He quit the job that he hated because he knew he no longer had the financial responsibility of a family.  He began purging his home of things that reminded him of his ex and began to indulge in the things that he was not allowed to do before.  Things were definitely getting better for _PERSON_ and he became much more open and less isolated. Soon after his ex's final visit, he called up a buddy of his whom he had roomed with before his family and asked him if he wanted to come and be another roommate to _PERSON_.  His buddy accepted and moved in.  As _PERSON_ surrounded himself with those that he knew and trusted, his feelings of lonliness disappeared completely.  Shortly thereafter, he recieved a very disturbing txt message from a girl named _PERSON_._PERSON_ was an aquaintance.  She was living with her boyfriend in another apartment in another part of town.  Her boyfriend and his roommates were people that _PERSON_ considered his new friends.  They were fun loving and chilled and _PERSON_ felt right at home with them.  _PERSON_ though, was the unknown.  She was quiet, almost to a fault.  She rarely spoke to him at all with the exception of asking him for a cigarette.  She appeared extremely sad and alone even though she was surrounded by those that supposedly cared about her.The text that he recieved that night was from _PERSON_.  She was extremely upset and apparently her boyfriend and his roommates were kicking her out of the apartment and she had nowhere to go.  She sent him several messages literally begging him to let her stay at his place, if even for just a couple of days.  _PERSON_ felt uneasy about the idea as he did not really know _PERSON_.  After all, there had to be a real reason they were kicking her out.  _PERSON_ discussed her situation with his roommates and they agreed to help her as they did not want her to be out on the street.  _PERSON_ told her she had 3 days.  He picked her up and her belongings and took her back to his place where she settled in.  After a couple of days, he began to see a side of _PERSON_ that he had not previously noticed.  She was happy, upbeat, talkative, and charming.  The change in her personality was apparent to everyone who saw her.  _PERSON_ had changed from being a quiet secluded person into something completely different.After seeing this change and enjoying her company, _PERSON_ told her that she could stay on as a permanent roommate.  As time passed, _PERSON_ began to develop feelings for _PERSON_.  He did everything he could to hide these feelings as he did not want to rush blindly into anything.  He was finally at the point of enjoying being single and he did not want to offend his friends with whom she used to live.  Over time, however, she began to show affection toward him.  She showed an interest in him but kept it secret as well so that there would not be drama between _PERSON_, her, and his friends.  How does this story end?To be continued.....""---------------------------------------------------------------Only we know how it ended...I kicked her lying deceitful and manipulative ass and told her to go back to her little fabricated world."
dygoj,22829,AskReddit,1288389853,Seeking advice from those who have been near rock bottom,"So a quick sum of my story...well sort of my story but it affects me to a certain extent:This involves my Girlfriend whom had recently gotten into a car accident in her 2009 toyota corolla.  The car was paid off and it was her very first car.  Damage in total is 6-8k and it is currently sitting at a collision center with no methods of getting repaired now....Now, before anyone goes straight to judging...I am a full time student and work 25-30 hours mon-fri and my girlfriend had a job which made her travel a lot and she had made 10/hr but it basically evened out to 8/hr and long story short some family issues occured and she went back to houston.  Needless to say things are smoothed out with the family issues and she is back at my place..sadly no job and HAD a car for roughly 2-2 1/2 weeks.  She has several medical issues which those who know how it is - medication in this country is outrageously priced.  So for the longest time she wasnt able to get on her parents insurance until recently which was pure luck.  With not being on insurance and what not she wasnt able to afford anything more than liability insurance as @ 23 it was running her 130$ a month for liability only.  Full coverage was going to be $250 a month and she most definitely couldnt afford that.  Stupid mistake yeah, but health is always a #1 priority.Last week Friday around 5-5:30pm she gets into a car accident in which her front end was completely smashed in resulting in 6-8k in damages.  We by no means have a lot of money at all.  She said that she had slammed on the brakes because as some people on here who are from houston know: rush hour traffic is horrible.  _PERSON_, she pressed on the brakes and stated that it had not slowed down but felt a little acceleration and by the time she was going to use the emergency brake it had been too late and she hit someone, causing no damage to the other vehicle - SUV of some sort and she had possibly hit the trailer hitch or something of the sort judging by the damage that i seen.  All this week, while stressing out on tests that I had coming up I had been thinking of ways I could possibly help my girlfriend out mainly because I calculated that if I were to take ALL the money I have left over after bills at the end of the month, then it would take me 2 years to get 6,000.  Her great aunt was the last resort as this woman is fairly old and has money, but lends out money quite a bit and we had went to Houston today all the way from the Austin area to get some things from the vehicle and then hope to talk with her aunt in regards to this situation.  _PERSON_ father had stated he would pay her great aunt every month along with my girlfriend as well if she were to give her the money to repair it.  We have also contacted Toyota because when the recalls first hit the news, we went to the toyota dealership where my family lives and this individual told us ""Ok, wait in the mail for a piece of paper indicating whether or not you are on the recall"" and unfortunately we received no such thing.  Later we find out this vehicle IS part of the recall.  This situation is such a mess and I had contacted the collision center and asked them how much of an offer would be on the vehicle as-is if a buyer was found and they had someone come out and look and was offered $2,000.  I personally saw the car today as I had stated above and the front end is pretty smashed in...the support beams are bent and kind of pushed outward...you can basically tell the effect of the collision.  I am at a complete loss and have tried calculating how much all of the stuff in my apartment is valued and there is no way that I can liquidate enough of my assets to get close to 3-4k.  I feel so shitty right now and feel completely horrible for my gf as the car has only 44,000 miles on it and they quoted us 6-8k in damages.  My gf doesnt even care if it looks like complete shit as long as it runs and is driveable..mainly fixing the core aspects of the damage in the front.  I feel like we are completely screwed right now and all the shit that has happened to this girl in the past 10 months is unfair beyond anything.  I know there are people worse off than what we are but things are VERY shitty and no one should ever go through the mess my gf has gone through within the past 10 months as I had stated.  Those of you who have been in a SORT OF similar situation, or even those who can give friendly advice and guidance then by all means please do because I feel so shitty knowing that I have no ability to help her out even though I wish I could do ANYTHING for her.  I cant figure out any way to get 6-8k in a short time period...especially in a legal manner.  Life throws some fucked up shit, but I cant imagine it being any shittier than this :/Time to release the hounds and get flamed for something that is/was out of my control.....Hopefully some nice redditors out there would be willing to lend some guidance."

On top of that I have been dealing with consistant water bill issues, shit breaking, oven cooking temp being ~200 degrees off.  1x1 apartment525sq ft @ $750/month-I was told to get an oven thermometer to ""fix"" this ~200 degree temperature difference....no replacement or anything of this oven.-Water bill became really high - this months bill $55....I have lived at apartments before but not to where a 1x1 has a $55 water billThere are no leaks that I can think of but they finally replaced the oven temperature sensor after at least 7 months of complaining.  Also once I got this ""water situation"" fixed, I was told that they could no longer credit me for overpaying 40-50$ for water after they fixed it (went down to ~$25).

I have been going through some rough times lately and I am indeed posting from my main account.  There is no reason for me to hide behind an anonymous username.  I have friends and family that I may turn to but it just isnt enough and I have absolutely no idea what to do or how to deal with it.  My story:Roughly 2 1/2 years ago I met this amazingly beautiful woman.  She is petite and has the most kind eyes that compliments her beauty and all.  In the past 2 years that we were in a relationship we had our ups and downs but I refuse to look at the negatives because I want to remain positive about it all...especially right now.  We know how to push each others buttons and that had been done quite a bit.  She had left(moved out) a couple times and through us speaking she had came back.  Some of those times it was my fault and some simply by her choice.  She had been in a marriage previously and I was there to pick her up - at the time as a friend.  Through my kindness I offered her a place to live and she moved in with me.  Things got very serious from here but before her I had not been in a relationship for 5 years or so.  I paraded her around like she was my trophy and I would do anything to be able to do that again.  She also has two children which her ex refuses to take in so thankfully they are with family....unfortunately given certain medical conditions its hard for her to take of them by herself.  I am not asking for people to judge her decisions and what not because I was right there with her when most of the decisions were made and frankly her ex wanted to place them up for adoption and I told her she should not consider this as a thought at all.  My depression isnt what this is about.  A couple months ago we were going through rough times and basically she broke up with me on facebook to ""send a message"" which I found childish but nonetheless I would be a hypocrite if I were to say I had not done childish things either.  Either way many arguments ensued thereafter.  I had went out and did my own thing just so I could get away from the stress and have a little breather. _PERSON_ I am in the position she was - all alone in this 1 bedroom apartment loathing on everything that has happened and thinking on the past and what I can remember that was somehow locked away in my memories that I finally extracted back out.  It was a couple weeks ago in which we got so deep into an argument that I told her to get out and basically took the apartment key she had on her keys.  This threw her off the edge because she was telling me about how she has no place to go.  That is when I told her ""do you not see how much you depend on me now?"" and in all honesty I now know that I wish I could go back and just erase those moments because I am so fucking lonely, sad, depressed and what not that I cannot get over it.  It isnt the fact that I have no one next to me to say ""I love you"" to, or to kiss, make love to, etc.  I simply miss HER.  I miss her touch, scent, everything.  Every single second of the day that I am away from her it tears me apart emotionally.  We live in the same ""town"" and are roughly 5 miles away from each other or so.  I am here for school and work and frankly I cannot just leave and I prefer not to.  It hurts so bad knowing that you are so close to the individual you consider your soul mate, all b.s. put aside.  People say ""Time heals all wounds"" but I hate that fucking cliche phrase because in all honesty time will not heal this ""wound"" because I feel that the only moment in which we are going to be ""finished"" is ""till death do us part.""  We lived with each other for 2 - 2 1/2 years and it was common law marriage based on that alone but after these past couple days of loathing on my emotions and what not and finally being able to pull those memories that I once had as well as the feelings I know what it is that I want and what I want out of it.  I would do anything just to have all that back because those fond memories and emotions that I have had locked away have came back after having been gone for so long.  Something placed a barrier on my emotions and now the way I was before is how she is now.  The relationship we had was something way different than what anyone else has and I know that is something that everyone would say but this was completely true.  I loved showing her new things because it was like showing someone what is outside of the box.  I have been in tears nearly every day and I cannot hold my composure anymore.  The only thing that puts me at ease is seeing her and touching her.  I went to the bar on thanksgiving and had me a couple drinks because I did not want to go to my parents house(I live 30 miles away) and pretend to have a great time.  I love my parents a lot but its only half of what I need right now.  I spoke with her yesterday because she does have compassion for what I am going through because I put her through it and I wish I had not done so.  It fucking hurts and I have been searching for answers in all the wrong places and have yet to come up with any solution except one that I am placing hopes and dreams on - to be with her again.  She has been having employment issues because it is hard to come across a job her.  I wish I could do away with all of her hardships because this woman deserves a lot.  I spoke with her today when I went to pick her up.  We came back to my apartment because I have been an emotional wreck the past couple days and frankly I will continue to be.  I am not going to get closure, nor do I want closure because I am resting on hopes and dreams of being able to be back together once again because after going through this I now know what it is that I had been seeking for so long.  As stated before, those emotions that I somehow had locked away for a while have came out and I am ready to just give my entire heart to her because I know that is what she had wanted.  When we spoke I broke down and just told her how I felt entirely and I could tell she is trying to put a barrier up and to not show much emotion because she went through this.  I refuse to place any barriers on my emotions to mask my sadness because I do not want to lie to myself.  I cannot love another woman as much as I love her and I will continue to stay true to that.  It sucks but closure is not an option for me.  When we spoke(roughly a couple hours ago) she told me that she hates seeing me like this and in all honesty It would stop if she just understood and accepted my emotions but I cannot make her love me...I can only hope and want for her to.  I know she browses reddit every now and then and If she comes across this then so be it.  It isnt my intention to write this in hopes of her reading this but for me to simply reach out to people.  I am in a very bad state of mind and school is almost finished and with this on my plate...it has caused me to feel like I have no hope.  Love....its a crazy thing.  I have had maybe 1 thing to eat in the past 2 days.  The last good meal I had was when she came over and we cooked.  My emotions are in a whirl because a week or two ago we had made love and you just dont make love to anybody unless there is some attachment to them.  I understand that I am a guy and that guys have reputations for ""fucking"" anything that walks...but that isnt me.  I can get lost in this womans eyes and not have a care in the world.  Cooking isnt the same without her, neither is watching a movie or listening to music.  Music is what brought us together...we have a passion for the same genre of music.  What I like she likes is pretty much how you sum it all up.  We came from two different lifestyles and had the same kind interests and through those interests it brought us together as one.  Now she lives with her friend and this friend basically told her that she doesnt want her talking to me because of having to console her.  This makes absolutely no sense and frankly I want her to answer for herself and not have her friends tell her what she can and cannot do.  She told me that her friends is her family here and what not and to me that tells me what I dont want to hear when I dig deep into that response.  I just want to start a life with her and for us to have our own life but that seems like too much to ask for.  I cannot take this emotional pain anymore and while it sounds suicidal...I actually welcome the end because that will then be the end of any emotional pain.  I want to continue to grow with this woman because I know we can have something so great and all we need to do is start with a clean slate.  To sum it up - I love her and I want her in my life, not as a friend but as my lover, soul mate and my friend.  Holidays will never be the same again.  I have no idea what to do because anywhere I go she will be there with some sort of reminder.  What can I do to stop this pain without placing barriers on my emotions????  I seek the solution to being able to once again bring that love back from her."
mtefz,22829,depression,1322580738,I do not know how much more I could take...,"I dont know what to do about this emotional heartbreaking pain.  I am not looking for closure and its fucking killing me because I do not feel that ""we"" are finished.  I have spoken to so many friends and even my folks and nothing is doing it for me.  Despite being a suicidal thought...the only thing that I would say that prevents me from downing many sleeping pills or something of that sort is the fact that those around me that care about me will be hurt.  Everything that I see, hear, feel reminds me of her and my hands are tied right now with no ability to do anything.  I am so fucking hungry and cannot force myself to eat.  I am weak and vulnerable emotionally and physically and I do not know how much longer this can go on without something giving.  The love I have and how I feel I simply cannot put away and do not want to.  I do not want closure and I know that can and will haunt me.  The only thing that has offered me comfort is seeing her and being able to hold her.  No other woman could do that for me right now, only her.  Sleeping for a long time sounds so good right now..."

The reason why I may be complaining is because it is just as hypocritical if not pushy like religious people claiming if you do not believe in ____ you will go to hell.  It seems just as ignorant as the ""evil christians.""  I am for religious freedom and freedom to believe what you want...and my belief is just that..my belief so I will not mention whether I believe in a god or not...because that does not matter to anyone but me.  I notice that the Atheist thread itself is full of links/articles/etc trying to discredit whatever ""god"" it may be....almost as if its being tossed in your face to say ""Hey look you need to learn the facts behind religions and how they are fake.""

I have reached that point of post-grad depression and realizing/feeling that I made a huge mistake getting an expensive paper weight that isnt helping me whatsoever.  I graduated in May with an International Business degree but my primary focus was marketing...albeit not a communications degree but I learned mostly about the various elements of the marketing mix and _PERSON_My question is in regards to how I should approach looking for employment in the marketing field.  During my studies I was employed by the University for roughly 8 months as a Marketing Designer - basically a Marketing Assistant and a Graphic Designer.  I worked with a team of 3-4 others (its been a couple years).  I helped out in the planning and execution of various events for a specific department, Designed marketing materials for the advertisement and promotion of the specific department's ""services"" for students, faculty, alumni and non-students.  The graphic design side of this required that I create weekly advertisements for the school newspaper on a set deadline.  I was also given the opportunity to help in the design process of the brochure for the new million dollar recreational facility in anticipation of the grand opening.  It may not be much of an achievement for most but I felt excited in having had my hand in this....I guess my main question is what is my best approach to trying to get into the marketing field?  I desperately want to move to austin and am having little to no luck right now.  It doesnt help out that I have maintained a steady job in Technical Support for the past 4 years almost as of next week.  Marketing is definitely something I have a passion for but feel so lost in trying to go about this other than trying my best to network.

Last night I felt like having a decent meal since I had a nice 3 mile run and felt full of energy to do some kitchen cleaning and food prepping.  I spent a good $50-60 on ingredients for meals and so I wanted to make the beef patty with the mushrooms for any of it went bad.  As far as macros go on this I cant exactly provide you with that information since this was something I felt like making off the cuff.I utilized various recipes from all over, not specifically just reddit or cavemanketo (which btw is an awesome site) but some of it _PERSON_ come from those aforementioned sites.  After cleaning, drying and removing the stems, the portabello mushroom caps were lightly rubbed with olive oil (probably a teaspoon worth in my hands) and then light sprinkled with some cracked peppercorn and sea salt on both sides for both caps.  Lightly bbq'ed them (mainly for the charred marks) but ultimately let the heat cook them and dry them out on a raised service away from direct heat.  They turned out really well and werent as juicy as I would have imagined.  It just took patience and time...definitely a lot longer than 20 minutes.The burger was pretty simple.  At the local H.E.B. here in Central TX I went to the meat market and got me a cracked peppercorn encrusted beef patty.  After having cooked it I would say the patty was roughly 90%/10%.  I usually still to medium at best when it comes to burgers as I dont want them to be dry.  It turned out really well given my issues with cooking the burger right which is something I have always seemed to have an issue with.  The asparagus was cooked a little too long on the tips but I just cut them off as 90% of the rest was just fine.  The side salad listed here is usually my go to if I dont make my own tatziki dressing sauce for my salad.  I think the options I have open for this kind of food lifestyle is whats envigorating.  There has been a considerable boost in energy, overall happiness and as of right now since november/december - 25 or 30lb's dropped which is nice because I  I saved money by slimming down and being able to wear old clothes I havent worn in ages lol.  Although I would contribute that 100% to keto I would say its definitely 50% keto 50% exercise for me.  I tend to run 5x a week with the running plan that I do (2 days on, 1 day off) in which it runs on a 10 day cycle where the 10th day serves as my 2 days off.

If you were to ask me to run 2.5-3 miles non stop 4 months ago I would have told you that you were crazy.  Ive passed on the knowledge that I have gained from this subreddit to anyone who cares to hear me out or cares to better themselves as it has definitely benefited me.  At times I plateau as usual but its all part of the process and I dont let it discourage me as it isnt the first time nor will it be the last."
2ww9xo,22829,memphis,1424716721,Memphis Craft Beers question,"I want to start off by saying that I did come across [this post](_URL_ which is very helpful.  One issue I am running into is finding places where you can go to buy any possible bombers/cans.  Some of the places I have found sound like stores where you could purchase such items but end up being a small restaurant/pub deal.  The researching that I have done seems that _PERSON_ and Ghost River are alright in terms of quality but thats based off online opinion.  Perhaps some of you folks in the Memphis area could provide me with some insight on this matter as I love trying different things.  So far I hope I can get a hold of ""Gotta get up to get down"" ""_PERSON_"" and ""_PERSON_"" as they peaked my interest.  The family member that I have in memphis right now is staying around Beale Street.  I am compiling an organized list for them in hopes of not having them run around all over the place.  I am open to all kinds of suggestions from my bellow beer nerds!  Thank you for taking the time to read my post.  Below is what I have so far on my list:**Wiseacre Brewing*** Gotta get up to get down * _PERSON_ *(doubt this will be available due to it being an oktoberfest but ive seen situations like that at bottle shops)** _PERSON_ * _PERSON_ Just came across [this lovely gem](_URL_ - _PERSON_ Shop?/Memphis Cash Saver?.  Pictures alone tell me that its a pretty damn good place for bottle searching.  What are the chances of getting some memphis locals from there?"
32tctr,22829,moto360,1429198699,Moto 360 Matte screen protector?,I did a search limited to just this subreddit and couldnt find anything related to a matte (anti glare and anti fingerprint) screen protector.  Some of the ones I am finding on there have a lot of mixed reviews and dont seem to be matte afterall.  I saw one user in here in the top posts that had a full body skin on his with no cracking issues and was interested in finding out what brand that was as well but that information wasnt posted.  Could anyone chime in on their experience and/or recommendation?

Anyways:Basically, the book cover has a whole bunch of drawings on it, one that you would find in any typical student notebook. One particular drawing is of a naked lady, and they put black bars to hide her boobs/vagoo.Some parts of the story were (spoilers I guess):He meets a girl, on the beach and gets an erection. He's ashamed, but she sais ""Hey, maybe i'm wet for you"" or something to that extent. I think they get together, then she moves, and leaves him her dog.He follows her, and I think enters the school as a girl, or at least dresses up as one at one point.He also has a sister, in which he pokes holes in her boyfriend's condom. He has sex with his friend's mom in the trailer outside of the house. One specific line I remember was the mother saying ""Do you want me to to squeal like a school girl?"" in which he responds ""No, that's fine"".The dog gets lost/killed, but at the end of the story, he goes to visit his dad? and there are a bunch of puppies that look exactly like the old dog.It was a weird story, but it was trippy back in middle school. Again, I don't know why my memory has recalled the book (maybe the meds?), but I must find it again.Thanks Reddit. :)Edit: I think it had revolution in the title? Teenage revolution? No clue."

I had a lumbar discectomy (I think that's how it's spelled) a few years ago and I basically just got lazy and gained a lot of weight over that time.  The surgery did not help much for my lower back, but I think that's because I did not do the stretches I was instructed to do (because of lazyness as well as pain).Anyways since I started YRG my back and the nerve that shoots down my leg has been really painful (especially when I try to sleep).  Has anyone had a similar experience? does the pain go away as you become more flexible/balanced?"

I started one a few weeks ago but even after 2 hours of working in silence and basically ignoring everyone to hide my nervous stutter,  I got home and vomited.

I've been taking B-12 tablets in the morning and i ordered a bottle of L-Tyrosine.I realize now that I've never had fun or been to an event of any kind without alcohol involved.  I feel scared and lonely without it.  Whenever I go out to a bar I usually focus on the beer in my hand and just calculate how fast I can get drunk rather than join in conversation.  I feel really out of place, especially at my work.  I don't know what to do with my time socially.  I know I should get back to working out.  I have a bad back so the gym is not an option for now.  DDP yoga is good to get back in shape.  I realize I've pushed all my friends away.  Whether it was over paranoia or just drunkenly treating them like shit.  I know I act out because I'm insecure and just really lonely but I have a hard time controlling myself.  Hopefully being sober for a while will put thing in perspective for me.  I don't want to be another alcoholic like the rest of Florida or my family.Sorry for the rant...I swear I'm not drunk."

I search the internet for every single movie that could be remotely scary to me.  I like to think I've built up a tolerance to horror.  It's a very rare occasion when a movie actually disturbs me.  Almost every horror movie recommended on here were never considered scary to me.  They may be cool and fun to watch, but I just never get that sense of fear.  Maybe a jump scare will get me but we all know it's the ""slow burn"" that really fucks you up.The only movie that really fucked me up was The Grudge.  I'm 23 year old male and I still have trouble falling asleep from time to time because of this movie.  If the thought of that fucking face and that gurgling noise ever cross my mind, you better believe I'm going to be on guard for a few more hours in bed.  Last night I had the same familiar feelings after watching ""It Follows"".  Everytime I closed my eyes I imagined someone slowly creeping towards me through my doorway, which of course made me keep my eyes open for hours.The thing about The Grudge/It Follows is that it seems the monster/ghost only gets you when your guard is down.  You can run, you can hide, but it's coming for you and she will kill you the minute you think you're safe.  Imagining this gives me so much anxiety.  With most monsters there is something you can do to prevent your death, but with ""The Grudge"" and ""It Follows"" you are destined to live a life of fear around every corner, lest it gets you.  Every day will be planned specifically to avoid the monster.   It wants you, and though it's slow, it's not stupid.  It will never eat, it will never sleep, you will never be safe, because it will never stop."

24exon,3000,gay,1398903429,I'm a bottom; are hemorrhoids a problem?,"Ok so I'm 17 and in January my ass was really hurting, I went to the doctor and I had a hemorrhoid. After about a week of cream and suppositories, it burst and there was no more pain, but it grew back like the next day (which I guess happens when something bursts). Since then I haven't had any pain, and it's not as noticeable when I feel down there. However it's been so long that I don't notice any more, but I'm pretty sure it is still very much there.I did use some cream every night to try and shrink it, but it seems to just keep coming back. Like, it would go down to a fairly unnoticeable size and then the next day I'd pass a stool and it would be back. I changed my diet to have more fibre and water as well.Anyway, to get to my point: this is really embarrassing to have at 17. The cream doesn't seem to be a very good solution so I am thinking of getting it surgically removed.Because of the hemorrhoid, I haven't had sex in a few months and I'm scared of what a guy would think if I have it. If you're a top/vers, would it be off-putting to you? Also, I'm wondering about what happens with treatment. The doctor said that the cream should reduce it to a minimal size but there will still be a bit of extra skin there. I don't like the idea of that; if a guy is fucking me I think my butt wouldn't be good with that.I've also been told that having surgery would leave a small scar. This sounds a lot better, but I've done a bit of reading and apparently there is a risk of the anus being damaged after the surgery.Basically, I don't know what to do. Is a hemorrhoid an issue? The idea of it being there in sex freaks me out, and I don't want to have sex until it's gone. It's also really embarrassing to have when I'm only 17.What should I do about it? I really don't know. I understand that once you have them, you pretty much are going to have them forever in some way or another, which is just depressing. Maybe I've got this whole thing wrong; I don't know.Sorry for the ramble, this post was really poorly written. Any advice about either sex with hemorrhoids or hemorrhoids themself would be really appreciated! &lt;3Oh and a final thing: since having this problem, I am needing to do a number 2 much more often. It used to be once every day or two; now it is 2-3 times a day. I don't know what this is due to but it seems unlikely to be a coincidence. It makes me think that I'm not getting everything out each time I go to the loo, if you will - which also has me worried: if there's a load of poo being stored up there, is that going to be a problem when having sex?"
2byhjb,3000,buildapc,1406565744,[Build Help] Don't know which GTX 780 Ti to buy,"I've recently received some money and I've been planning on a major upgrade to my PC for some time.I would like to buy a GTX 780 Ti but I can't decide which one to get. I'm being tempted by the Zotac OC (non-AMP) as it is significantly cheaper than equivalent cards, but I'm also worried that it won't have good overclocking, and there are no reviews that I can find for it.I know it sounds crazy talking about price when you're at this high level, but I really don't want to go overboard with it. I'm having to buy a new case and PSU to support the card, so the whole thing is quite expensive.Are there any specific cards which aren't too expensive but that you would recommend? High out of the box clocks would be preferred since I don't want to OC right away as it voids the warranty."
2ghfgr,3000,gay,1410806955,"Slept with friend, accused of rape","Maybe this subreddit isn't the place for it, but I thought I'd come here since it definitely revolves around sexuality.A few nights ago, me and some friends went out and got wasted. I went home with my best friend and we slept at a friend's. He is 'straight' and I'm openly gay.We ended up sleeping together. He initiated it and he was top (I'd never be anything but a bottom!). We talked for a bit about sexuality beforehand, and we ended up having sex.He was very drunk but it was certainly consensual. However, he now claims that he cannot remember any of this, and doesn't know anything except that he went back to the friend's house and passed out.But he's now told me, as well as all of our circle of friends, that I raped him. He said he wasn't sure whether to believe me or not at first, but the friend we stayed round has now said to him that he heard it happening, but said that he (the one I slept with) was ""out of it"".If he does remember and is saying this to protect himself, he certainly has reason to. He has a girlfriend and he is a bit of a player - girls won't want to go near him if they know he had unprotected sex with a gay guy.My friends now hate me, and I don't know what to do.Any advice? :("

zjfp0,30014,Drugs,1347072833,"r/Drugs, I need your opinion on something...","So r/Drugs.  Here is the back-story.  At age 17, between junior and senior year of high school, I was introduced to marijuana.  After becoming excitedly involved in the drug (as well as a single acid trip mid senior year) and partaking in it on a daily basis, I have recently arrived at college.  Here, I have rested upon the decision that marijuana is not ideal for intellectual development and progression.  However, in my first few weeks here, I used both mushrooms and LSD (mushrooms multiple times, LSD once), and came upon profound new developments in both my intellectual/emotional state (very positive developments, I might add), but have recently come to worry about the permanent alterations that I may be making to my mind as it is not finished developing until age 25.  Within the past week, I have sworn off all drugs and alcohol until said age, but am now realizing the ramifications of such a pact.  I want to continue my development and self-realizations, but don't want to damage myself in the process.  I need your opinions on this matter.  I will not be using them to MAKE the decision, but rather to help me to see all of the relevant evidence and sides to the problem at hand.tl;dr: 18, in college, used hallucinogenics, not anymore because I want to preserve mind, reconsidering choice, need opinions to see the big picture.EDIT: Well, after some weeks of making huge changes in my life, last night was somewhat of a culmination.  I ended up tripping (very foolishly) on 4 doses or so, resulting in some bad tripping due to conflicted feelings when starting out.  I am now sober(ish), okay, and putting myself back together.  I am taking things slowly now.  It is my belief that no rapid decisions should be made at this point, and I am taking life a minute at a time, trying to progress through the day.  Last night was a harsh awakening.  I have been humbled by LSD and it's incredible power.  Working on accepting culpability for my actions and somewhat self destructive nature as of late."

One of them just recently opened up to me the other night when we were both very drunk, and she told me that her father molested her when she was little, and that she hates her parents.  She cuts herself and keeps a noose prepared in her backpack.  I am scared.  I am scared that I am going to wake up tomorrow and have 1 or 2 less friends, and I don't know what i'd do if that happened.I have suggested to both of my friends (the other one is not quite as depressed but he is currently hardly functioning in life, not focusing on school, also has serious family issues) that they seek professional help.  They have both rejected this idea and said that they will continue to internalize it.I am at a loss for ideas, I spend a huge amount of time talking them out of crazed depression and often worried about suicide threats.  I can't handle this forever, and i'm doing everything I can for them but I don't know what is right and what is wrong to help them.Please offer me some advice.

I was able to simplify the magnitude of the velocity vector into |v(t)| = sqrt(a1^2 + a2^2 + a3^2) * t, which I am not sure the correctness of.If, just for the sake of simplicity, we say that:x = sqrt(a1^2 + a2^2 + a3^2)Then |v(t)| = txThen the Unit Tangent Vector T is:T(t) = &lt;a1/x, a2/x, a3/x&gt;Where a1, a2, and a3 are just constants, as well as x (because it is composed of a1, a2, and a3).So when I go to find the _PERSON_ Vector N, which involves T'(t), it will just be 0 because the derivative of a constant (a1, a2, a3) is just 0.

I'm sorry I couldn't reply to everyone but I have been reading most of the comments throughout the day. There was a lot of good advice here. I will be taking him to get scanned for a microchip maybe tomorrow. I had to go to work for a little while and then have been spending time with the little guy.

I sprayed him with my dog's flea spray and I'm going to try to give him a bath tonight with some oatmeal flea shampoo. He's a lot happier so I think I can get him into my car to go to the humane society to get checked out. I called but they didn't have any lost dogs that matched his description. I'll keep trying and I've completed the found dog poster. I'll ask around my neighborhood as well. Thanks everyone and I will try to respond to as many of you as I can. Also, as requested, I will update the story as I know more. Thanks a bunch! UPDATE 2: Here's my new post updated. There's some pictures in there after I gave him a bath and fed him.

I'm an atheist and a lesbian. They are fundamentalist baptists. Basically I don't talk about who I really am and they don't either. We all just pretend the real me doesn't exist.

I expect to be stuck staying with them for at least three months. While I'm with them I'll have minimal privacy and although I'll be able to use their internet, I think I'll be expected to restrict myself to sites they would approve of.

A year later I tried to find it again and possibly read more by the author but I couldn't remember the title or author's name and the library seemed to have gotten rid of it. Well, this is what it was about ...A planet that was colonized by an extremist religious group. They believe that it is perverse and vulgar to speak about yourself and the words ""I"", ""me"", and even ""we"" produce reactions of shock. At birth everyone is assigned two others, and male and female, with which they can talk about themselves. Those two people do not talk about themselves to eachother, they each have one other they are assigned at birth. After a few centuries there is structured civilization. The protagonist is a prince who flees the kingdom when his brother takes the throne to avoid conflict. He meets a guy who has a drug that allows you to feel everything and know the thoughts of your fellow drug-taker. The ultimate intimacy. He becomes awakened because of the drug and wants to share it with the society. That's all I remember but there is another book that I think was by the same author about a future earth where scientists playing around with genetics produce new intelligent life forms. Specifically, flying fairy-like ones that fly at night by the moonlight and brutish ugly stupid ones. The protagonist travels all the time watching the skies, being employed to watch out for alien invasions that never come. He travels with a flier and a brutish type who is oddly articulate and fascinated with the world around him. He turns out to be an alien in the end. So ... anyone know what book it was??(I didn't read over this for grammar and spelling mistakes. I'm too lazy.)Edit: I posted this on _PERSON_'s Book Sleuth Forum and got a response.

When I get up and try to do anything I start panting after a few minutes. I end up laying around most of the day and even then just turning over will cause me to breath heavily for fifteen minutes. This started about three or four months ago and the doctor told me I had hypothyroidism. I took the medication but got fired from my primary job at around the same time and moved in with the parents. The plan is to stay here until I feel normal again and then get another job. Meanwhile I have a few housekeeping jobs that I have somehow managed to keep with some help from my mom. I make $300 a month now. The doctor recently told me that my thyroid levels were normal and so was apparently everything else they had tested for. She gave me a B vitamin shot in the ass and told me to stop taking some antibiotic that I had been taking for acne. So far I feel just as bad as ever. I'm not looking for medical advice. I just need to make the decision to either do what I've been doing and possibly have to quit the little bit of work I'm barely doing now or force myself out to find an office or receptionist job where I can be sitting all day and just tough it out. The problem is that I really don't know if I can even handle that sort of job. It's exhausting today just to sit here and type. I'm desperate for help and I guess I'm turning to reddit as a last resort. My mom's best advice is no advice at all and a plate full of food. I appreciate the food but I'm still freaking out. Also, get mad at me if you must for not using advice reddit but lets be honest, you get three responses there if you're lucky."

I sit around in my room all day playing video games, wasting time on reddit, etc. I have no friends except one who I've never met and lives in, of all places, Egypt. After moving back to my hometown a few years ago I never managed to get out and be social because of my health and being self employed and not around people very much. I've never had a gay friend besides an ex who I was only obligated to stay friends with in order to avoid drama. Anyway, I'm not looking for any sort of romance or anyone local since I can barely get up and take a shower some days. Just need somebody to chat with. Maybe someone out there is in a similar lonely situation and could use some company. Update: Really didn't expect much and I'm really grateful although somewhat embarrassed about the attention. I've responded to some of you already and will probably look the rest of you up later. It's really exciting to me to talk to some gay people, as pathetic as that is. As great as straight people can be for friends, a lot of them don't really get it if you know what I mean.

What should I do?,"I had a job as a live-in housekeeper for over a year and left the position right before Thanksgiving. I lived in an apartment over the garage which had its own kitchen, bath, and entrance. I paid nothing to live there and only got a free place to stay for my work. I can't say I liked my job there or got along with the family very well but I had no reason to suspect anything.Recently my mom found a small article in the local paper about a girl moving into an apartment and finding a camera in the air vent. It listed the street where I had lived. It's not a big street and it really made us suspect it was him. A few days later mom found that his son who lived in the house half the time that I did was a sex offender convicted of rape. So being the curious woman that she is she phoned the local sheriff and asked for information.The sheriff freely confirmed our suspicions. What happened was that a girl moved in and hadn't been there a day when she found the camera. As soon as she discovered it he knocked on her door asking forgiveness and begging her not to report him. Well she did report him but then wouldn't come in for appointments to talk with the cops. The guy is rich and they suspect that he payed he to drop it. Also, something that seems weird, he drove her home to a town three hours away. Ok well, I'm not sure how to feel. Obviously I feel betrayed and a little freaked out. I told my mom that I had checked for cameras and I don't think there were any but I'm not really as confident as I made her think. It's perfectly possible I was video taped naked. I walked around naked there every day. I even remember thinking I saw something reflective in the vent and not having something to stand on to take a closer look so I dismissed it because I'm used to dismissing my own paranoid tendencies. Well, this guy has a lot of rental property in more than one state. I feel like he deserves to be confronted but I'm way too much of a wimp to do so. I doubt there is any way I could find it if I'm somewhere naked online. There's probably nothing I can do but any advice would be appreciated.TL;DR Former boss where I used to live may have had a camera in my old apartment. Another girl who moved in there found one and it was in the news. Advice?PS. Didn't check for spelling and grammar. Get over it."

Help.,"Recently I have a lot of wild dreams and in all of them I'm male. Be it a little boy, an old man, or a teenager, always a guy which seems totally normal in the dream. This has resulted in thinking about my gender identity more than I usually allow myself to.Anyway, I took my ambien as usual last night but then was chatting with my best friend online. He knows I don't identify fully as female but I always look and dress as female and I'm always kind of vague about it with him. Because I was kind of out of it on ambien I started talking about it and told him I would like to change my appearance and maybe have top surgery. He was generally accepting but said that he wouldn't want me to because he can't be so close with a guy. I told him it would only be the outside changing and I wouldn't really be a guy anyway. I kind of think of myself as half and half and I just struggle with the outside not reflecting that. I don't even know if I could ever undergo any kind of change like I talked about. Not even just wearing mens clothes. I don't think I could do it unless everyone in my family died, as stupid as that sounds. I try to be more accepting of my femininity and just live my life. I don't want to be some kind of unexplainable freak. If I could go back and be born as male I would do it but I can't and the alternatives aren't appealing. Right now I just feel embarrassed for what I said last night and totally confused about whether I meant it. I don't know what I want. I know I sound like a classic case of ... whatever, but I honestly don't know what is up with me. Whenever I think about these things I just have a huge sense of dread and hopelessness. I'm just posting because I could use a kind word from someone who has similar experiences.tl;dr It's just a big typical whine about gender issues. Read it or don't."

fzj25,10076,loseit,1299558635,It's not as good as it looks ...,"I'm sitting here feeling quite a bit depressed because I worked hard on my diet for two long weeks and lost exactly no weight.  I was thinking about how depressing it is to face that if you want your health and looks back you have to live without something that you really love. I love baking and I love cookies and cakes. It isn't just that I love eating them. I love them the way I love reading, pc gaming, learning about science - I love it as part of something that makes my life happy and I love to get good at and feel proud of being good at. I started dieting recently because I had this epiphany that shouldn't be so mind blowing but it was. I have control over eating things. It's not my parents fault that I eat junk foods. My family keeps leaving junk food out in the kitchen and I'm so sick of looking at it I've actually learned to pick up oreo cookies ... and put them away.Right now I was thinking about those cookies and the cookies I ate (a lot of cookies!) when I finally gave up this weekend (don't worry I'm back on the wagon today). I thought about how they taste, what it feels like to pile a plate full of warm cookies and gobble them up with a tall glass of milk ... not really that great. The excited, emotional, sinful-feeling anticipation for the thing does *not* live up to the thing itself. When I ate those cookies this weekend I remember in the middle of it thinking *this should be greater than this after two weeks of no sugar*. Anyway, I'm still depressed about giving up baking but maybe this was the next epiphany I needed to get on with things."

I'm a little worried I'm not doing it right. Although I'm losing weight, I keep feeling sick and don't want to eat to the point that I starve myself. Anyway, here is the typical stuff I eat. Breakfast - 2-3 eggs with either butter and cream in them or with 2-3 slices of baconLunches - Salads with chicken or tuna, mayo or grated cheese OR Skinless chicken breast (yes I know) baked in broth with veggies and butter (I don't actually *like* butter on my veggies so sometimes I forget), sometimes broccoli with grated cheese on topSnacks - 2 celery sticks with cream cheese filling the middles OR a few bites of cheeseDinner - repeat of what I had for lunch or boiled/scrambled eggsI eat currently 4 or 5 eggs every day. It's what I eat when I don't want to eat. Any suggestions are very welcome. I'd like to add some variety and flavor because lately everything is nauseating to me. I'm not really eating things that I like a lot but thats mostly because I don't know what else to eat that I can stand. I've spent my whole life eating mostly carbs every day. I don't like beef or pork. I used to go days without eating meat at all just because I'm not fond of it. TLDR; Just read the menu part and give me a guess whether I should eat more fats or proteins."

I want to get her some uplifting audiobooks and her faith is what keeps her going so I think something Christian would be good for her but I don't know where to start. Something that isn't controversial or focused on theology. Just everyday advice kind of stuff. Also novels would be good especially about American pioneers or farmers (not focused on romance). Movies or sermons would be fine too if she can follow it without being able to see it very well and it's uplifting. Thanks! EDIT: Sincerely just asking for help. I mentioned I'm atheist because it explains why I'm lost on trying to pick things out for her. Just ignore what you don't like about me and take an opportunity to help a lonely old lady.

I'm not disfigured or wheelchaired. I look healthy but feel terrible. I live with a very loving family that takes care of me but they are fundamentalist homophobic conservative morons. I love them but they suck! I depend on the internet to keep me sane from day to day. I read a lot and am addicted to puzzle games. Watch a lot of movies and tv shows.

I'm kind of embarrassed to be posting this because it feels pretty pathetic but if there is anyone else out there who is for whatever reason stuck in life, spending a lot of time online, or can only have an online romantic relationship... I don't really expect anything to come of this and I'm not looking for people who feel sorry for me who will talk to me a little bit now and then.

ksciv,10076,AskaPharmacist,1317080608,"The way that doctors use the word ""addictive""","I find that doctors are dishonest in the way that they use the word addictive in order to avoid conflict with their patients. For example, SSRIs are very physically addictive and it's not uncommon at all for a person to have a hard time weaning off of them or having bad side effects if they happen to take it late or forget taking it but doctors don't even tell their patients that it is addictive. They don't mention it at all and wave away concerns about it. Now take a drug like _PERSON_ which I've been taking for a long time on a daily basis and I find that it is not addictive at all. Zero withdrawal. But when I try to renew prescriptions some doctors refuse to prescribe it, saying that it's too addictive. I don't take anti-anxiety pills but have requested them before and been refused for the same reason. Let's be real. They say that _PERSON_ is addictive but what they mean is that you can get high on it. Same for pain meds. Doctors don't care if things are physically addictive or even emotionally addictive. They only care about preventing their patients from getting high even if that means often keeping meds from people who really need it. I know this isn't totally the fault of the doctors but the fault of society and the system etc.Ok. I guess this turned into a rant. I'm done."

I'm mostly concerned with my grandma. Her health is declining rapidly, she does have lung disease and a tumor but she could never tolerate treatment so doctors are mostly concerned with improving her quality of life. She has tried to quit or cut down on multiple occasions but this is a woman who has been smoking since she was 13. I have to be extremely careful in my choice here, not only in whether or not I get one for her but what to buy. I'll also have to convince the rest of my family that it's a good idea for her. I want to emphasize that it has to be an extremely extremely small risk or none at all. I've read the statements against it and the refutations. What I really want is the hard and clear science and/or statistics behind e-cigs in general and for certain brands. I know there's already a lot of info here and elsewhere but I'm having a hard time wading through it. Would love if people could give me some reputable links and advice. Thanks!EDIT: Should add that she is legally blind. She needs a bright light and things up close to see anything and I don't think she can read anymore. Last week I tried to show her a pic on my iphone and she couldn't make it out. That said, my aunt could make sure things are set up for her before she goes to work in the morning. She doesn't have a problem being home alone because she knows where everything is. Do you think she would have any problems with it?"

I had an extreme reaction to medication and at one point was mostly paralyzed. Not in pain but was experiencing something that I can only describe as beyond pain. Hell. The worst thing imaginable. Torture.When that wore off after about twelve hours (which indeed might as well have been twelve days) I found myself speaking like someone with palsy and then flailing around uncontrollably and making insane sounds. I could have forced myself to be still but the movement and noise was the only slight relief from the insanity I was feeling in my body. The slurred and fucked up sounding speech coming out of my head, although frightening and embarrassing, was my only contact with the world so I kept talking talking talking ... _PERSON_ the entire time - and I know this may seem like a strange thing to be thinking about at such a time - I repeatedly thought about _PERSON_ in hell. Maybe the show was the only thing that had ever really made me imagine that sort of torture but that's just what kept coming into my head. When things finally started to get better and I slowly entered the normal world and became myself again - my own voice, my body under control, my thoughts completely communicable - I just kept thinking that I had to post here when I came home. It's hard to describe to my loved ones what I've been through but perhaps some of you, like me, have vividly imagined the torture portrayed on the show. Torture that leaves you somewhat damaged and traumatized in a way you may never quite get over .... Once something like this happens to you maybe it opens a door of knowledge that you would rather not have had opened for you. Knowing exactly what is out there to suffer through at any moment makes life quite a bit darker. It's quite a bit harder to just keep on living. Keep on smiling ...When I could barely speak I forced out the words to my mom ""It's ok for me if I die."" Now, I've never been really afraid of death and I didn't wish it even then ... that's just how much I love my family ... the worst thing about death is the idea of them grieving. Idk I just wanted them to know that for me it would be ok even if it wasn't for them."

Time to dive in!","[Time to dive in!](_URL_ **About the Course**&gt;Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of humanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale to kiddie lit to myth; from ""Cinderella"" to _PERSON_ in Wonderland to Superman; from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting _PERSON_. From a practical viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction, from _PERSON_ to _PERSON_, is the most important in our modern world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind, shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will explore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art and as insights into ourselves and our world. **Course Syllabus**&gt;This course comprises ten units. Each will include a significant reading, typically a novel or a selection of shorter works.

Because of _PERSON_ and his show I finally sought a therapist after eight months of PTSD and telling myself my problems would just go away. I've taken steps in several areas of my life and I wouldn't be the same otherwise. He says over and over every ep that people should find a therapist. Turns out he knows what he's talking about. I filled out one of the surveys a while back and he read it on the show. Knowing that so many people heard what I was feeling, probably many of them sympathising or even going through the same thing, and just that _PERSON_ was moved by it and gave me one of his big hugs was such a boost for me. I bookmarked the spot on my podcast app and have listened to what he said at the end many times. **Thanks _PERSON_. A big hug back to you!**I am disabled so can't give much but after that **I just couldn't not support him financially. So I give five dollars a month.

Now that it's been over two months and both humans and my dog (Jupiter) are well adjusted to the newness of things and have learned a lot I feel like we (especially I) need to train him more consistently and often, with planning and purpose. Forgive me if I ramble. I'm thinking out loud a bit here. ... typing ... out loud ... whatever.For starters I'm going to try to focus on instilling the ""come"" command but it's among other basics that he's already half-learned. Questions: I want training to be part of everyday life. Is it worth it to have treats on my person at all times and if I do won't it just distract him from what I'm saying? I feel like he would just hound me for treats 24/7. Will he get used to the scent being ever-present? Will treats being smellable all the time or dispensed throughout the day make him not care about them as much? Is it worth it to get a pouch designed for carrying dog treats or can I use a ziplock bag in my pocket. Problem: I don't always have pockets. Maybe I could just try to keep the bag close at hand when I don't have a pocket? Does the treat have to be given quickly and would using a ziplock slow it down too much?I have a couple of Iphone apps that simulate a dog clicker. Has anyone had any experience using those? I worry about using a regular one because I have stupid hands from neurological disease so pushing on something repeatedly might be painful if it isn't a ""soft"" enough button. So should I get a regular clicker and what kind? Would it be handier, more quick and would that matter a lot? I'm not not worried about the fashion issues of wearing a fanny pack to carry some dog things. It that my best option for my situation?If you have any other random advice throw it out there! I'm a novice!"
1t4vv3,10076,Dogtraining,1387330730,Ok. Jupiter is nuts about squirrels. There is literally NO WAY to take him outside without constantly being around squirrels. Help?,"We live in a wooded neighborhood where squirrels are in literally every tree. You can't look out a window or walk down a single street without seeing them everywhere. It's impossible to use the walk away method.So Jupiter is so caught up with these little rodents every time he is taken outside that he often won't do his business, will jump around on the leash/spaz out, and barks like a nut case. Even if I manage to walk away from the squirrel he is presently fixated on I run into another squirrel immediately. Today I took a spoonful of peanut butter and every time he tensed up when spotting a squirrel I immediately let him have a lick or two. I also practiced sit, stay, leave it, and his potty commands with the peanut butter (watching him eat peanut butter is hilarious btw). There was absolutely no barking although we passed the usual abundant amount of rodents while I walked him from the front to the back of our unfenced yard. He only managed a growl or whine once or twice before I stuck that spoon in his face.There was also construction a few houses down which kept his attention while we sat quietly for a few minutes and traffic and the neighbor getting in his car and leaving. Sometimes he barks at stuff like that and sometimes doesn't. Today with the pb he was pretty chill during those moments comparatively. He was definitely alert to all of it - he gets intense body language and sometimes takes the pointer stance for these things but today sat quietly - not calmly but still and quiet. I could see his mind fixating. Sometimes he would already be so fixated on a squirrel or two that he would actually try to look around the spoon in his face (*which was a huge scoop of pb*) to stare at the squirrel. (I'm getting tired of saying squirrel). I don't remember where I read about this method but is it a good idea? I've read it's a bad idea and in others that it's the way to go. Are there multiple methods for this that work all the same or what??PS If my neighbor's dog did this I would be annoyed so I really want to fix it. He also sometimes sets off my next door neighbor's large dog (who rarely barks) and then somebody comes out to check on him/her so I feel a bit embarrassed. PSS Please feel free to suggest any range of advice. I'm with him all day and have plenty of time for training. TL;DR - So many squirrels. _PERSON_ dog who bothers neighbors. What do?"

Smart as can be, affectionate, hilarious, trainable, etc. He's perfect in my eyes. I'm well aware of the huge costs that can go into the supposedly cheaper route of rescuing and me and my mom (fellow dog lover in the family) are prepared for that. We have a great vet blah blah blah. But Jupiter came from craigslist and I've never been to a shelter before. I've been reading up on the best way to choose a shelter dog and feel more or less confident about my own common sense abilities and knowledgableness. I'm the one who reads up on dogs obsessively. I'm the one with twenty dog books in my kindle and a few on my shelf. I'm the one who highlights them for Mom or sums them up for her.I'm afraid she'll go in there too excited to walk away empty-handed.Ok so the story is that we were told by a couple who just adopted a jack russel that they saw a black toy poodle in the (overcrowded and underfunded) shelter in a nearby county and the shelter is waiving fees for people because they want the dogs to be saved. This is the exact breed and even color my mom has been texting me pictures of for a while now. She's really excited about this and calling me a downer for trying to point out some of the reasons we might have to say no. I keep picturing myself having to pull her aside and tell her ""this dog is too aggressive for us"", ""this dog hates other dogs and we have Jupiter to think of"", ""this dog has too many health problems for our budget"", etc etc and I'm not *entirely* sure she will listen to me. In the end if I feel I have to I'll tell her I won't help her raise it as a way of putting my foot down. That's worst case scenario. I might be worrying too much. Mom isn't a child right? I already told her some of my deal breakers and we'll talk more on the way there. So does anybody have any encouragement or just comments for me? Even just stories?"

The things he gets aggressive about: People: treats, not kibble, objects, not the ones he knows are his toys, grooming (but only sometimes)Dog-dog: (specifically, the only dog in his life, my mom's dog that lives in the same house) possessions, treats, kibbleWhat has alerted me out of my complacence is the fact that several days ago he actually bit me, angrily, and enough to hurt but not leave any mark. I was trying to get a gum wrapper out of his mouth. I gotta say I was shocked and hurt. I went to my room with him and put him in his crate and just sat so that I could think. Once I started thinking I knew it had been building up. It's been a long time my mom has told me he scares her when she bathes him and that he nips in her direction but I don't think has ever actually bit her. We've had to be careful with him and _PERSON_ (Mom's dog) because of his possessiveness but I thought I had been getting that in hand by making him go to bed if he growls at her.I've been alright with training both of these dogs but this is baffling me right now. I've just been avoiding his triggering things since the incident, not knowing where to start. I think I'm too emotionally involved to figure it out. Things I've tried in the past:1) If he gets hold of an object he shouldn't have (often my gloves) he'll growl and not let go or respond to ""leave it"" but drops it as soon as I go to the counter where the treats are. This makes me feel like I'm rewarding his bad behavior so I stopped it.2) If he stiffens and growls at _PERSON_ I send him to his bed. (He *always* obeys that command so I don't have to drag him to bed or anything. Also, he likes both his regular bed and his crate and I don't know if that is relevant.) Then he has to sit there and watch _PERSON_ eat the treat or play with the toy. He won't get up until I say ""c'mon"".3) I've tried calmly walking up to him and holding the other end of the object without pulling until he lets go. Sometimes I look him sternly in the eye.

It's not much different because he's a guy. My parents are doing weary faces from paying for shit and interacting with the other family trying to plan. Every female including myself is fretting and spending money on outfits (fucking hate clothes shopping). Everything is so expensive and inconvenient no matter how thrifty and reasonable everyone is trying to be. I'm just the sister, expected to do nothing, but this wedding is going to cost me hundreds. The tension generally mounts as the date looms. Frankly, I'm dreading it. My mom told my other brother that if he doesn't have a wedding when the time comes she will give him money to start their life together instead. We all hate weddings!Those of you who have had weddings, what made you feel it necessary? Those of you who have gone to a lot of them, how do you feel about them? Is anyone else like me - would never do it unless it was extremely important to the SO?"

I usually do as much charity as I can since I have depended on charity my whole life. I know how much a little money is worth to people.

2t5v1s,10076,kratom,1421841027,Started taking Kratom for pain. Mixed results.,"I'm disabled and in constant pain. The pain is neurological in nature and I don't bother with opiates because they don't do a thing. I use other medications that make life tolerable but I'm still housebound and often bedridden from sickness including terrible pain. I wanted something for when I have really bad pain days so this is what I ordered form GetKratom.com: **2 oz _PERSON_, 1 ounce _PERSON_ I wish I hadn't done this but when I got it I mixed both into a small tupperware. **I've been taking one teaspoon at a time using a 1/2 tsp measuring spoon.** This seems like the simplest way for me. I've taken it about five times now and I think I'm building a tolerance despite spacing out the days I take it and using it as a sort of emergency medicine for when I really can't bear the pain. It feels to me like an opiate most of all, with some mild-altering effects if I take more. **Opiates make me nauseated and dizzy so I am taking a dramamine (motion sickness tablet) an hour before the kratom and this eliminates that problem.** Thought this might be a good tip for people who get nauseated easily. The best result I had was today. I had terrible pain in my legs. I won't try to describe how severe it gets. Just impossible to distract myself. There's only massive pain. So naturally I dug out the Kratom and it basically **took the pain from my legs.** Not to mention I've been typing and using the computer for hours now which is usually pretty painful! **I'm also pretty focused which gets hard because of my prescription meds.** I'm really glad I shelled out some money to try this stuff!That said, it is starting to wear off faster, make me less sleepy, less high. I'm worried the pain killing effects will wear off if I use it too often but boy is it tempting!If I can keep using this I think I could start writing again which I haven't tried to do in five years due to the pain. I've also taken my dogs out twice which is a damned rare event. I'm 31 years old but I live with my parents due to the disability and I hid this Kratom thing from them. I didn't want them googling it! It's awkward hiding anything from them since they are all over my life. (I love them to death but it's not always easy living this way. Basically like a child.)So that's the story. I hope my experience helps someone looking for pain relief. **Ask me anything relevant.** **I used bold text to point out the main stuff because I know this is a long read.**"

Once from a neighbor who grew some in a small patch of woods by the railroad tracks. I lived in the town's shittiest neighborhood. These details just to give you an idea of the quality. A few years later I grabbed some from my rich employer's house. I don't have a clue how or where he bought the stuff but he always had a shit ton of the stuff.Both times I've smoked it was before I got sick so I don't even know how any kind of weed would effect my pain. I do know that meds that are aimed at neurologic pain help me and opiates do not help at all. In very different ways I'm also extremely intolerant of alcohol and always have been. Ask if you really want to know but I don't know if it's relevant at all. Ok so in both instances I enjoyed it but it resulted in deep depression for about a week after use. I would get high as a kite. I seem to have no breaks once I get started. I don't know what kind of strain or anything like that obviously.

1ds0tb,42332,ShortStoriesCritique,1367819590,sunsets are the worlds words,"I am not a writer, this just came to me while walking on some trails near a beach at sunset. Criticism would be greatly appreciated. I like sunsets. They stand defiantly, occurring day after day, clear or cloudy skies. They speak for the earth, almost shouting “the trees, bushes, and flowers will wilt, you will kill your best friends and all the fauna wandering this earth, but you will never stop me. I will continue to spin, circling the sun. The waves will never stop, no matter how many fish die, or shells fade, they will continue to roll, week after week, year after year. You can pollute the air with all the noxious gasses and harsh noises you want, I will never be conquered.” As you walk up the winding trails (which the best places to see these rebellious spectacles are always on) the plants brush past your skin as if to say “we let you pass today, but tomorrow we will claim your cars, homes, and roads”. The view is always worth it, various lichens grow off the rocks, as unmovable as a stubborn child, and the red, oranges and violets creep through the trees and over the oceans. Once the last speck of sun fades behind the waves, and the long standing mountains (whom we owe our existence to), you turn and walk through the darkening forests, the friendly plants now tearing at your clothes and hair. The wind whispers “don’t leave just yet” and you take a wrong turn.  _PERSON_ reach down and grab at you with spindly, pine scented hands, the first frog croaks a drawn out “ruuunnnn….” and you quicken your pace just a little bit. Your poorly shooed feet ache and you crave just a little more light. The trail gets rocky and almost impossible to navigate and the wind whispers a slow “why don’t you stay awhile?” to which you respond with a firm “not this time!” The first stars twinkle, and you take the last clumsy, stumbling steps toward the first gasp of gasoline filled air and step onto the highway built by the civilization who started it all, and one day, will end it."

I'm only 17 years old so it may just be teen angst but I feel just simply depressed a lot of the time. I would not let it get to the point that I would kill myself because I know I can't do that to my family. I just look at everyone around me and I feel like every single person I'm close withs life would be better off without me. I know killing myself couldn't solve that problem though. I just imagine a world without me and everyone seems more happy. Its like that episode of fairly odd parents when Timmy makes the wish that he was never born and sees how much happier his parents and friends are. I feel like that is me. My parents could have saved thousands of dollars that they put towards my education. I just needed to share this with someone. I know this may not be a big deal on this subreddit because its looking out for people who are on the verge of suicide but I would love for someone to talk to about this. I tried talking to my girlfriend about this but what pains me is that I don't want to make anyone in my life unhappy. I know telling people I wish I was never born would not blow over so well.

Upon arrival I go to the fire station in search of pistol ammo. I heard gunshots so my defences were up. So I climbed the ladder to the top of the station and I see a guy, so I stop climbing.

29y2fa,13151,conspiracy,1404619631,"Justice is dead. Too many are above the law, and we're exploited because of it. Opinions?","It's my opinion that there are numerous wealthy and powerful individuals that are sick individuals, above the law, and possibly are part of an interconnected group/organization. Their actions range from pedophilia, murder (assassinations), bribery, blackmailing, economic exploitation, and plenty of other crimes. The wealth, power, and connections these individuals have essentially made them above the law. A lot of people in this world, particularity in the US, are simply untouchable. I see this as a huge problem facing our society today, our courts and various petty laws have become a tool used to keep the poor and unfortunate oppressed. Individual freedoms have been limited by said petty laws, so has our bank accounts from ludicrous amounts of fines/taxes. Justice should be applied to everybody equally, and when it doesn't, it creates a mockery out of our laws. Or more accurately, it creates a system of oppression for those who have no influence over world affairs. That's how it seems to be, at least by my perception.There isn't real justice anymore; the lower class is fined/jailed via petty laws, while corrupt persons are generally protected from their crimes, even when it's against humanity. Cops shoot unarmed men, and almost always their trail is a farce; leading to just a paid vacation. People with power get away with all sorts of crimes, way more than we are aware of. People, or groups, continuously getting away with their crimes is one of the reasons we have a poor economy and infrastructure here in America, presumably. I find it appalling that corrupt bankers, stockbrokers, and corporations can so easily exploit both the working class and the economy continuously; extensively rigging it in their favor, breaking numerous laws in the process, yet they receive no punishment. No new regulations, no oversight, nothing is done to prevent it and solve a real problem. Instead, they get bailed out with our money; even though they've been stealing it for years. To be fair, sometimes they'll be fined a minute amount but it doesn't put a dent in them. Overall, I'd say most of them are never caught, and maybe some aren't supposed to be. I've been alive for 21 years, in that time I've seen an astounding amount of horrible, guilty people set free and given special privileges; all because they had money, power and connections. That's crooked justice. _PERSON_ has no blindfold. None of those politicians are going to be given a proper trial, if any at all. I'd like to hear what some of your opinions are on the current state of justice here in America, or wherever really. Not just justice, but the laws we have, the ones who break them without consequence and the affect on society."

I'm going to call my friend's cop brother _PERSON_._PERSON_ is a very evil individual backed by wealth. He's currently on the police force as well and is a practicing Satanist. He has Satanist bibles and meetings, which is fucked up. Other than that, he had raped an underage girl, who is my friend's, and _PERSON_'s, very own sister. After it had happened, the wealthy family swept it entirely under the rug, forbidding any member who knew. the sister, the brother bob and my friend, to say one word about it. Nothing was ever made of it, and couldn't be due to the wealth and connections these people have. TL:DR; So basically there's a practicing Satanist, who's still a cop, he raped a little girl and nothing was made of it. So we have this bastard cop, this satanic individual, patrolling our streets and without justice. I'm sure there are plenty like _PERSON_ out there, and it's sickening.

There's nothing to bottle up and nothing to show. The summit of my knowledge, and my will to help others, is of no value since I am probably a scumbag. Right now, all I'm doing is looking introspectively without bias. All I see is a man who's ego caused all his good intentions to be of no meaning or consequence.

I'm not at home with her, but I wish I was. I remember when my sisters and me met at her house, she wanted us to take her to rehab, she had been drinking for years, and wanted out. I can't believe it has already been 5 years. Upon reading her text message. Many memories came back to me. Especially the car ride to the rehab clinic and how closer we got the more she wanted us to turn around the car. When we were 15 minutes away, the roles had reversed she had now become the child crying, and being scared, and angry. She kept crying ""turn around, turn around"". And I remember sitting in the car, a promise I had made her when I was a child, that when she gets old I would be there and take care of her as she did me when I was a child.And it seemed that, that time was at that moment. She was the child and I was the grown up. It was such a strange day, at one hand I felt happy that we were taking her where were going, on the other hand I felt sad and hated to see my mother like this.My mother loves chocolates too. And I remember a few hours before we left for the clinic (mom was getting really drunk, for one last time) and I was packing her bag for things to take with her. I asked if she wanted some chocolates with her, she said no, but I snook them in there anyway for her to find. But there would be no amount of chocolate that could ease her pain in recovery. She was faced with dealing with her past, and my sisters and me were called in a few weeks into her therapy, where we learned one of the reasons why she had been drinking so much. She had been sexually abused by her grandfather as a child.This information, wether you are someones child, parent or friend will tear your world apart. And suddenly I understood why she had been drinking, and I wanted to buy her every bottle of vodka in the world if it could ease her pain for just a minute.But my mother being the strong (i.e. stubborn) woman she is came through it. I would like to say she battled her demons, but truth is she battles them every day, and she has to fight the thirst everyday. But the difference is that now, 5 years later she wins the battles. It has been 5 years, but it feels like it has been only a few months. She reminded me of a new-born when she came out of rehab, shaky, insecure and extremely vulnerable. And I guess in many ways she is a newborn tossed back into the world that caused her so much pain, without the comfort of alcohol.And of course I am proud of her, and even as I'm writing this I have a lump in my throat and feel the tears flooding my eyes. I'm not here to just to say how amazing she is or to brag. I am here, writing this because there are so many people like her, who struggle with their own demons, whose quality of life as been drowned in the dark depths of alcohol. And my heart goes out to you. To you who do not have a family, to you who drink for reasons that are darker than anything I could ever imagine.The only thing I feel I can do, is share my (my moms) story and maybe let you know that you are not alone. And my mom's success story is the only one I know so I want to tell it to everyone who is willing to listen. To this day, my father, both my grand fathers, my uncles..well lets face it all the men in my family are alcoholics(the ones who aren't are the one who drank themselves to death). And sadly my oldest sister who was the one driving the car that one day 5 years ago has also become an alcoholic. So my mothers success story is the only little light that shines in the darkness of the fates of all my other family members who fought and lost to alcoholism. And that little light is the only thing I can share with you who are battling your demons on a daily basis. And I would like to hope that maybe it shines just bright enough for some to see life clearly, even if for only a second....and yes, she did enjoy the chocolates I snook in her bag, later when she started to feel better ;)"

My heart breaks when I think about them, and I cant understand how she could just leave. I knew her life was hard on her, she used to call me in the middle of the night sometimes and we'd talk for a couple of hours, and she said she felt better. And I always told her that I would always be there if she wanted to talk, or have a good cry, or just to have fun...whatever.And now I sit here going through feelings of being sad, and angry at her. And I also feel so ashamed because its the first day today on a week off from school, and my first reaction to hearing the news when my boyfriend woke me up was, it's gonna ruin my holiday, and I feel so ashamed for that being my first thought..I don't know what to do, and i feel like i failed her."

1yzys2,44772,relationships,1393431614,Me [29 M] with my BF [39 M] 8 years. I feel like s**t for having to shoot down his biggest dream.,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for 8 years. We are planning to get married next year, and we will be having a baby too. I this entire process is pretty scary, but also terribly exciting, I love the thought of staring a family with him. That is not what this is really about.We looked at houses together a few years ago, and after being denied a loan from two banks, we agreed that we'd wait until i'm done studying to look at houses again. But he has been looking online after houses and been meeting up with estate agents, turns out he has found a rather old house in the middle of nowhere, and today I wake up to a text message from him saying that the bank will give us a loan for the house!He has been talking with the bank behind my back! One of his biggest dreams I think is owning his own house, his friends are all pretty well established and are house-owners. I think that plays a huge role in why he wants one. And I want one too eventually.The thing is that he has schizophrenia and can only work part time, and I'm currently studying. There is no way we could ever buy a house together right now, I feel like it is madness! And it's not just a house, it's a rickety old thing that will need massive redoing.And now I'm just sitting here, feeling like I'm an a-hole for being angry with him for doing this behind my back. Like I'm the one killing his dream, at the same time that I'm furious at him for not respecting me enough to tell me that he is in the process of buying a damn house!If I was going to buy even just a jacket or something that might be quite pricey i'll tell him. I won't ask for permission per se, but i'll let him know. That's just how relationships go I think. Being open and honestHe certainly has not been open and honest, and yet here I sit feeling like the a-hole for denying him his dream...Apart from the financial side of things, that it's probably the worst time to buy a house, there is the emotional side too, I don't really feel I'm ready to have a house too. Getting married and having a child is no problem, but I feel like I'm not ready to buy a house t settle into permanently. So...am I the bad guy here for being upset and angry. I can't even tell at this point.(we live in Scandinavia)---   TL;DR: my boyfriend has applied, and gotten granted a loan from the bank to buy a house, without me knowing anything about it.Edit: clarifications"

You get a strong lime flavor, but that's about all I could pick out from it.Cut was very juicy, lighter in color than something like tangiers but definitely a natural color. Pretty chopped up, but not really really finely chopped.The flavor was phenomenal. I was amazed at how smooth it was, and it tastes just like a lime with a little background hint of something a little stronger, along the lines of a tequilla but not that strong. The lime is definitely the standout flavor. Clouds are HUGE. Biggest clouds I have ever gotten from anything, and ive smoked my fair share of tangiers. Like I said, the smoke is very smooth and very clean. Overall, an awesome flavor, id give it an 8.5/10, only because it is very light(which isn't always bad). Definitely would recommend!"

I'm not talking close on a personal level, I'm talking physically. _PERSON_ and I on a few occasions have knocked on the door of intimacy without crossing the threshold. She has also been saying things that some may consider to be a bit more than flirty. Things like, ""If I had met you before my boyfriend, I would totally be dating you right now,"" and ""If I didn't know who you were and saw you at a bar, I would totally hit on you."" She has asked me if I have ever had a crush on a friend, and she has been extremely flirty with me by bumping me with her hips at work and slapping my ass. Here's where I need help. The last time we hung out things got pretty heavy. There was some heavy breathing and she actually grabbed my hand and placed it on her breast. We didn't kiss, and we didn't do anything beyond it. Immediately after it happened she said she needed to go to bed, and I left. This happened at her house around 1a.m. and we were cuddling on her couch. There was a bit of drinking involved, but it wasn't enough to even feel a buzz. I don't know if I am looking into this too much, or if there actually is something more going on. Keep in mind that she has been with her boyfriend for 5 years now. I'm not sure she acts this way with anyone else, and many people have made comments to me about the way she acts around me. So what should I do? We haven't talked about it, and she almost acts as if it never happened. We didn't even really talk after that day until recently. Should I talk to her about it? Should I bring it up? We're hanging out this Thursday. Help me out Two-x!!"

It was his second or third such event and the school had decided to give up on him. Because he always used over-the-counter pills, a bunch of us believed he wasn't really trying to die, just calling out for help. In retrospect we should have realized that he was using those pills because he couldn't get his hands on anything stronger. I dropped out myself at the end of the semester, got a room in a cheap boarding house on the edge of campus and found a job. I talked _PERSON_ into moving into the house with me because I thought it was better than the alternative, which was living with his parents, whose house was nearby but who seemed incapable of dealing with any human emotion, least of all his. _PERSON_ got a job as a night janitor at the college.After a couple of months another friend of ours named _PERSON_ also dropped out, decided to move out west, and talked _PERSON_ into coming with him. They settled into a one-bedroom apartment. _PERSON_ took the bed and _PERSON_ settled into a permanent spot sleeping on the couch. This didn't surprise anyone who knew _PERSON_. He had the lowest self-esteem of anyone I have ever called my friend. _PERSON_ found work in the new city but it was always terrible work, like sitting in a bulletproof booth at an all-night gas station, getting threatened and spat at by psycho customers. Almost a year went by. I was still working in the college town, while _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ did their respective things out west. We talked on the phone a lot. _PERSON_ always seemed so lost, and wandering into situation after situation that only made things worse, like those gas station gigs. Then came October 1980, and word that _PERSON_ was going to play a concert on his tour for ""The River"" in _PERSON_ and _PERSON_'s town. They drove _PERSON_'s beat-up car back to the college town, to see some friends, they said, and to give me a ride to the concert. Only _PERSON_ wrecked the car the night before we were supposed to leave. We were stranded. We had our _PERSON_ tickets, but no money. That is, until _PERSON_ came to the rescue. He made a couple hundred bucks appear as if from nowhere. He bought me and _PERSON_ two AMTRAK tickets back to the west, and said he'd follow us out as soon as the car was fixed. We would pay him back, of course. We all went to the train station the night we left. _PERSON_ and I sat alone on two of those hard plastic shell-chairs in a corner of the terminal and laughed our butts off, telling stories and just shooting the breeze. It was wonderful. I was starting to think _PERSON_ was going to be OK. He seemed so much more at ease. It wasn't until afterwards I realized why: He had made the decision to die. That must have felt like a huge weight off his shoulders. So he got me and _PERSON_ out of town on the train and went back to his parents' house. And on the night of Oct 20, 1980 he drove their car to a park where he had played as a boy and shot himself in the head. The call came early, and my head was still ringing from _PERSON_'s fabulous 4-hour concert the night before, and everything I had ingested during it. I was on _PERSON_'s couch, using his pillow and blanket in a futile effort to find, as _PERSON_ said, a way to hold my head that didn't hurt.It was _PERSON_'s mom, matter-of-factly reporting _PERSON_'s suicide, and asking if they could please have his personal possessions as soon as they could. I will never forget that hammer shot of astonishment, of realizing for the first time that he really had it in him to take his own life, that I had been wrong all along. And now it was too late to fix it. I remember stumbling out of the apartment and walking three or four blocks to a neighborhood bodega, not so much to buy anything but because I needed to get out. I walked in and the store owner immediately started yelling at me. I didn't understand what he was saying -- it may have been a language I didn't know, or maybe my brain just wasn't processing the sound of his voice. But I got the message from his outstretched index finger: Get out. It was only when I turned to leave that I saw my bloody footprints all over his floor, and realized I had left the apartment barefoot and stepped on something sharp at some point. I never felt a thing. Except for shame. I tried to apologize but the owner just kept pointing at the door and yelling.  I used to get sad every October, without really understanding why, and then I'd remember that the anniversary of _PERSON_'s suicide was coming up. This went on for maybe 10 years. More recently the date has come and gone without my really thinking about it. Though I still think about poor _PERSON_ all the time. Sometime in the past year I realized, for the first time, that _PERSON_, who was a huge _PERSON_ fan, killed himself on the anniversary of the plane crash. That sent a chill through me. And of course like so many humans, round numbers stick out in my head. So the 30th anniversary has been front and center in my mind these last few days. We were both 21 that day. I suppose he still is. I have a wife and kids, and have worked a bunch of jobs, including one I have right now that I love. I've been fortunate to see a lot of the world. I'm typing this on a laptop in the basement of the house I've owned and occupied for more than a decade. I've seen and done so many things I am grateful for having experienced, while _PERSON_ has lain in a grave not far from his parents' old house, frozen in time forever as a sad, confused kid. If you're out there _PERSON_ and you recognize yourself in this story, sing out. It's been too long. Everyone else: hug the ones you love for me and _PERSON_ today. And if you have a friend or relation who seems unable to get free from their demons, hug them extra. You may not be able to fix whatever's wrong. That may just be the way it is, and there may be nothing you can do. It's taken me 30 years to truly believe that. I wish you an easier time.      **EDIT:** Thanks for the many powerful comments and stories. To those who wonder: Yes, we had tried to get _PERSON_ to try some meds, but some of the really good ones hadn't been invented yet, and nothing seemed to help him. He tried to self-medicate with vodka but as you might imagine, that didn't help either.  **EDIT 2:** Special props to VoodooIdol for sharing his story of climbing back from the abyss. I think you saved a couple of lives today, my friend."

eddwx,14457,AskReddit,1291048880,"What the hell happened to Cairo, Illinois?","On Sunday there was a bad car wreck on I-24 near Paducah, KY, which shut the interstate highway for several hours. I was headed from Tennessee to Chicago and made a U-turn to escape the dead-stopped traffic, pulling over several times to let emergency vehicles race past me westbound on the eastbound lanes. Once I got off I yanked out the map and found  an alternative route. And thus for the first time in my life I drove through Cairo, Illinois. What on earth happened to that city? The streets were not just deserted, but decimated. The few intact businesses were surrounded on all sides by the abandoned husks of buildings, including a multi-story brick building downtown that had mostly burned down at some point, and which apparently no one thought needed to be knocked the rest of the way down. Right on the main drag.The only sign of life was a large processing plant on the river bank, which my traveling companion said looked like a rice processing facility. I was going to guess corn, because of the many elevators and football-field sized storage tanks, which looked like they were still serviceable. Practically everything else in town looked like it died. _PERSON_ tells me there was a boycott in Cairo in the early '70s by blacks fed up with racism by whites, who owned most of the businesses. That was an awful long time ago. Is the boycott responsible for the devastation? Or is it other things?I have lived in small, failing farm towns and even a large, failing farm town or two, so I know what economic drought looks like. But I have never seen anything on the scale I saw in Cairo. Have I just been blind to the depth of small-town blight in this country? Or is Cairo special? (And not in a good way.)Is anyone from there? Or familiar with the last 20 years of ""economic development"" there? I need someone to help me make sense of what I saw.    EDIT: Thank you for all the terrific information. Such a rich mix of firsthand experience and, gasp, genuine scholarship. Now I think I understand. Sad, sad story. And more common than I had realized. This nation is crisscrossed with Cairos. EDIT 2: And, I now believe it is inevitable that Cairo or some place like it will be bought as a gaming site. EDIT 3: I am flat-out astonished at all the activity this post has spawned among redditors. I wish you luck. Years dealing with dysfunctional government entities tells me you are up against more than you realize. But I wish you luck nonetheless. Let me know if I can help. I have some friends, for example, who are heavy into urban agriculture. And if it works, please name a street after me. Just a little one."
esoe5,14457,ProjectCairo,1293564352,What the hell happened to Project Cairo?,"Hello friends,I'm the guy who got diverted off I-24 after Thanksgiving, drove through Cairo, Illinois and posted the original ""what the hell happened"" query. I've been awfully impressed by the number and diversity of ideas that have been flying around ever since.But it's starting to look like the enthusiasm for this project dried up. What's going on? I'd also like to take this opportunity to address those people planning to devote significant time and human capital to the project, assuming they still are.Simply put, I think you are thinking way too small. And in some ways, you are thinking way too big.I am NOT knocking the sincerity of those involved. Let me make that clear.But I've been involved in a lot of community organizing and public-interest work, and from my perspective, I'd like to suggest some changes to the master plan. 1 - First, you are going to need some specialists to pull this off, including a lawyer familiar with real estate, a general contractor who knows something about HVAC and weatherproofing, and probably a project manager who knows how to cook three meals a day for 150 people (more on that in a minute). These people will need to be lured by some combination of adventure, communal leanings and/or actual money. 2 - These people, along with 20 or so people willing to live in extremely spartan conditions for up to a year, need to acquire a building and make it liveable for themselves. I'm talking sleeping bags on the floor here, but a warm, dry floor. 3 - Once that is done, the team needs to go about acquiring new properties and rendering those habitable as well, with the goal of creating humble but reliable housing for 150 people. 4 - The 150 must agree to live in Cairo for two years, beginning on a set date sometime after the first wave goes in. Everyone will have a job, but no one will be paid cash, or not very much. Instead the project will promise each member a warm, dry place to sleep and plenty of good food. People will be assigned to construction, weatherization, and other essential tasks, under the supervision and training of the contractor and other specialists. Others will earn their keep by performing other project-sustaining labor. More on that below too. 5 - Here's the tricky part, and really should have come first but I was afraid everyone would stop reading: Each of the 150 people has to pony up $4,000 in cash before they can join. This will provide Project Cairo with a two-year budget of $600,000, to spend acquiring and rehabbing property and keeping the collective afloat. I don't think Project Cairo can plan on receiving or spending a single dollar of donations during that first two years, aside from some small gifts from sympathetic redditors. Foundations like to see some evidence of success and the ability to self-sustain. Once you have some properties reclaimed and some semblance of a community started, then you can ask _PERSON_ or _PERSON_ or _PERSON_ or whomever to help you. 6 - In addition to the property-related activity, the project must develop a food store/kitchen to meet the nutritional needs of project members. In other words, while you don't get paid much or anything to be there, you get fed. I think this fits with the evolving idea of starting a food store. Full disclosure: I also have a background in food service, and so this element of the project seems basic and essential to me. A commercial-quality kitchen with perhaps 15 workers assigned to it could feed the collective and save a lot of money during those first two years. In this way Project Cairo would have a chance to take root. You'd have enough people in town to perform serious amounts of work, in a way that would create more capital for the project (properties worth more than you paid for them). You'd have enough folks around to form a critical mass around a coffee shop and other social/art/cultural activities. You could establish an urban agriculture program which would put more people to work at a useful-to-learn trade and further support the project. And, you'd have $600,000, which gives you a fair shot at making a two-year project work. Trying to get local youth involved, like trying to find grant money, needs to come later. You have to build something before you invite people to join it. I will not be joining Project Cairo. I'm already spoken for. But were I to do so: - I would plan to be in the ""vanguard"" that goes in first, preferably in the spring so urban camping is not quite so challenging.  - I would plan on camping out in urban squalor for a while, then moving into something resembling dorm housing after a while, and eventually, several years down the road, into a rehabbed house with a rational number of housemates to really share the bathrooms without ongoing problems.  - I'd plan to swing hammers and haul insulation that first year, and see to the installation of a commercial kitchen to sustain the 150 when they show up. - I'd want everything nice and legal, with properties clearly owned, repairs made to code, and all finances wide open to oversight by project members. That way you can build something a greedy or small-minded bureaucracy cannot destroy.Such is my four cents.Good luck. inkslave"

Now, is anyone still interested in Project Cairo?","I submitted the following comment over the holiday, and got some feedback that since most people were off making merry, I was missing a chance to reach a lot more people. So, here we go again. I still agree with most of what I wrote. Though comments from others have convinced me that building a food store/dining facility/commercial kitchen/coffee shop is going to be vital to making this work. And I now envision this as a three-stage process: 1 - Vanguard of 25 goes in to build the store/restaurant and living space for 150.2 - Six months later, most or all of the 150 move in and begin rendering more housing habitable, so everyone has reasonable access to plumbing and a plug to recharge the laptop, and accommodations are nicer than a warm, dry floor. 3 - After two years, the 150 will have built something others will want to be part of, by moving there or donating money or something. And yes, I still think the first 150 people have to cough up money for the privilege of working their butts off. They also get room and board and a chance to build something incredibly cool. It's a lot cheaper than college! _URL_"

She had been chasing it frantically for half a block.From where I was standing I didn't even have to move my hand to grab the push-handle. It slid right into my fingers and I just gripped it. The stroller stopped, maybe three feet before it would have pitched over a foot-high curb and hurled the child into a busy street. Mom came running up trying to thank me but she had been running hard, and she was so freaked out, that for a few seconds nothing but gasps came out of her mouth. Then she looked at me with a smile of pure relief and just said, ""Oh!"" I didn't want to embarrass her or make worse what was already a bad moment for her, so I said something out it all being OK and passed the stroller into her grasp, and walked away. Later I ran this over in my head. I just happened to stay home sick. I just happened to make that particular appointment in that particular building. It just happened to end when it did. And wildest of all, I happened to turn right instead of left at the exact moment when I needed to. Some of my friends call it God working in mysterious ways. I'm a little too much of a heathen to accept that. I just consider the odds and shake my head a little and wish mom and baby well from here on in.What incredible coincidences/strokes of fortune have you experienced?"
gq14s,14457,sports,1302799932,"A memory of _PERSON_, aka _PERSON_, one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, forced by injuries to retire this week","_PERSON_, the 37-year-old Canadian who wrestles for WWE as _PERSON_, announced Monday that a serious spinal condition is forcing him to retire from the ring, effective immediately.I've been a wrestling fan for my entire life. I know it's fake. I also know that it's not as fake as most people think. These guys are strong as hell, quick as hell and yes, they get hurt. _PERSON_ recently returned after tearing an _PERSON_ tendon clean off the bone a while back. He was playing heel when he left, beating up on the likes of _PERSON_ and The Undertaker. He came back as a ""face,"" short for babyface, which is what wrestlers call the guys scripted to be the heroes._PERSON_ is 6-foot-5, a lean 240 pounds, has long, wild blonde hair and the best insane/raging/lunatic wide-eyed stare in the business. Over the years he has specialized in some of the more insane gimmick matches WWE has to offer, such as the infamous tables/ladders/chairs match which, well, even if you've never seen one, I bet you can guess what they're like.  But in my opinion some of his best matches ever, and some of the best professional wrestling matches in the history of the sport, were his ""straight"" matches against equally talented opponents. Exhibit A would be his match for the World Heavyweight Championship three years ago at Wrestlemania 24, where he faced the best wrestler since _PERSON_, The Undertaker. These guys closed the show and that's the way it should have been. Nobody could have followed that performance.Taker is 6-foot-8 and when he's lean, goes about 290 (I know, he's billed as taller and heavier, but I have met him). Late in the match there came a couple of spots where _PERSON_, off balance, had to lift Taker clean off the mat and toss him. Try that for yourself on a consenting adult who weighs 150, and then imagine trying it on someone literally twice that size, on a live pay-per-view seen by millions, in a stadium packed with tens of thousands of screaming fans, after you've been busting your butt for 30 minutes. It was nothing short of astonishing to see. When _PERSON_ went down with the _PERSON_ injury I thought we might have seen the last of him. When he came back I wrote him a letter congratulating him and wishing him the best, which I would bet he never read, because it was probably one of thousands just like it that he received.  Shortly thereafter, he came to my town. He was playing face at that point, and I have video I took with my little point-and-shoot camera of him jawing with _PERSON_ and pinning the Miz.What I did not record, but what I will always remember, is what happened after the Miz match. _PERSON_ broke character, leaned against the ring ropes and talked for a couple of minutes. He apologized to the audience ""if I look a little rusty"" because he was still getting back into shape after the layoff and rehab. He called fan favorites _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ tot he ring and shook their hands ""because I haven't been too nice to you guys lately,"" a nice mix of kayfabe and reality that I admired. He even offered _PERSON_, a gigantic monster of a man who is probably the strongest guy in the business, a Tic Tac. And then he looked up into the crowd and thanked us for coming and said, ""Did you all have a good time? Because that is what it's really all about. Did you have a good time?"" Cue thunderous ovation. Yes, we had a good time. I had a good time watching _PERSON_ from start to finish. I am deeply saddened that he will no longer be able to do what I know he loves to do, and what he is one of the very best at doing. I wish I could shake his hand, buy him a cold one and thank him personally, but there would be a very long line of people ahead of me for a chance like that.So I'll settle for redditing. Goodbye, _PERSON_. Good luck, Mr. _PERSON_. I hope you find a good path to walk from here."

I got off lucky, a few degrees to one side and I could have lopped off several fingers. And It taught me not to be an idiot around sharp knives, in a way that has never dimmed in my mind.

1chtnf,14457,self,1366154101,I went to the Islamic Center in my neighborhood last night and knocked on the door.,"I'm not a Muslim, but I felt compelled to drive to the local Islamic Center last night. I parked across the street and headed over. There were a dozen or more cars in the lot and some of the interior lights were on. As I got closer I could hear the voices of men, some talking, some almost shouting. They all stopped cold when I knocked on the door. After a few moments the door opened a few inches. The man inside looked out furtively. When he saw it was me he smiled and swung the door open and we embraced. _PERSON_ and I aren't close but he knows me. We've done a lot of community work together. ""How are you my friend?"" he asked. ""I'm _PERSON_ let me go and we looked at each other again. _PERSON_ is a worrier, and tonight the lines on his brow and around his eyes looked especially deep. ""And you are here ... why?"" he asked.""I just came to see if you needed anything,"" I said. ""Maybe someone to sit in a car across the street and just keep an eye on things.""He smiled but as he did, a tear came to his eye. ""One of the ones who died was a baby, 8 years old,"" he said. ""I know.""""We will be done soon. We are talking about a press release.""""Good idea,"" I said.""Thank you for your offer,"" he said. Then he pointed down the street. ""But I think they are already doing that.""Sure enough, half a block down, there they were, two very still figures in a black Crown Vic.

I don't want to pressure him, scare him off, or say the wrong thing so I've barely said anything at all so far. I just sat in silence on the phone after asking him like two questions. I kept telling him I love him, because it was all I could say. I don't want to lose him."

Do something, engross yourself in some work and indulge in some hobbies. There is no point just sitting there. Find a solution or work on it.&gt; You are constantly thinking about death because you seek an easy way out of the problem. Whenever you faced a problem or an obstacle you go into panic mode and then think about jumping off a cliff or hanging yourself. It is your attitude that is wrong. Whenever you see a problem, find a solution. That is the best thing that you can do. Can you imagine how anyone close to you would react on hearing about your death? Wouldn't it crush their world? How would you react if you found the dead body of someone?&gt; You think you are losing control over your life because things are not happening the way that you want them to happen. You are not a genie. You can't wish for something and then make it happen. You got to work on it. If you were driving a vehicle and then encountered something blocking the road, you wouldn't wait in your vehicle for that thing to just disappear, would you? You would look for a way around the problem or just remove the problem. Same thing with life. Also, when you are driving the vehicle, you wouldn't complain that you are driving the wrong way and continue driving that way expecting to miraculously reach the right destination, would you? Same thing with life. You go where you are driving and nowhere else."

k0v3h,35429,SuicideWatch,1314843040,Back again!,"Ok guys. This was [me](_URL_ for the entire last month. I've was never in a depressive episode this long. Usually it would last for a week, at the max, and then I would be back to cheerful self again. I just feel better since the last couple of hours. I do not know why. I am going to see a psychologist  to find out how I can combat the next depressive episode when I have it. I have a fair idea how though. I've been through this shit and now I want to help you guys who are feeling down like I did before. I've been thinking about it since I got out of it. Here are a few points.1. During depression, the only thing that I was doing was thinking about suicide. I had no time for basic hygiene or proper eating. That is where I disgusted myself and this lead to more depression like a cycle. Make sure you are in a clean environment. If you are not, clean it up immediately. When your environment is organized, so are you. Take care of hygiene.2. When you are in depression, the worst thing that you can do is stop eating/drinking. I did that for roughly 3-4 days. Yesterday, I drank a little bit of water and felt sick to the stomach. Today, when I was back to normal again and tried to walk a little bit, I just puked because the exercise was straining me. Seriously, you do not want to do this to yourself. It is very painful and your stomach hurts like you were stabbed and the would sealed off, but the damage to the stomach wasn't corrected. Two bottles of milk helped with getting my energy back. Also, if you eat the stuff that you love or enjoy, it will be good for you and might help you a little bit with getting rid of the depression.3. During depression, as I mentioned earlier, the only thing that I could think of was suicide. I tried many of those methods and failed pretty bad. There is no sure-fire way of committing suicide. Each method is more painful than the next and the last couple of moments that you may end up spending in this world will be your most painful. That is what I learnt. My survival instincts kicked in and got rid of all the suicidal devices that I had thought of and because of that I am still here. Thanks for that. There is no easy way out. It's very difficult and painful. You may end up regretting it.4. My parents and my sister found out that I hadn't been going to office and called me and asked about the problem. My father almost broke down on the phone when he found out that I was suffering from depression. There are people that  care for you. I kept myself in a shell for about 40 days and nothing came out of it. I talked to my Dad and realized that he'd probably be depressed if I did anything to myself and would probably be asking the question ""What did I miss? Did I do something wrong? I could have helped him"" time and again to himself. He wouldn't find an answer because I am not rational when I am depressed. I am just trying to find a way out without worrying about the consequences. It's not like I have a life-threatening disease or can't do anything on my own. I am in working condition and instead of using it to the fullest, I am just throwing it away. For what reason? That I feel frustrated with life. That instead of solving the little issues, I just go like ""Fuck it"" and think about suicide. That is not the correct way to think. Please understand that. And seriously, if you have depression, go seek advice from a doctor. You are not the only with these issues. There are tons of people who suffer from depression and if not corrected within time, it ends up being worse and eventually leads to suicide. The people who care about the victim end up in trauma and depressed themselves. They are the ones who question ""What could I have done to stop this?"" They will never find an answer. Why do you want to subject people who care about you to that experience? Take care of them."

kjnnx,35429,TheCreedOfTheCrazyOne,1316368442,Help for SuicideWatch,"Ok. I've been trying to help on SuicideWatch all day today and it feels like everybody has the same problem - they are just unmotivated to go on and just want to end it then and there. Not that I do not understand their feelings. Yes, I've been there. I was depressed for an entire fucking month. I did nothing all those days. I just woke up. Surfed the net for some ways to kill myself. Come to the conclusion that nothing really will work. Think about stabbing myself. Again, coming to the conclusion that it will not work. Feeling like shit all day. Not eating stuff. Not drinking stuff. I just let the time pass by. For AN ENTIRE FUCKING MONTH. I am not sure what triggered the existential dilemma. But I somehow came out of it. I didn't do anything stupid. So thank _PERSON_ for that. I am not religious. I just believe in some fictional person who urges us to do good all the time. My consciousness or Batman within me, whatever. I am clean now. I am not going back to being that vegetable. I am gonna do something in life. I always wanted to do something in life. I wanted to be THE fucking linux administrator or THE fucking programmer. The kind of guy who you will bring your problems to and I will just dust them off like they were no big deal. So what did I do to achieve my dream? Nothing. Nil. Absolutely fucking nothing. Why? Because I didn't have the fucking time to do it. Or I was busy jerking off to porn or just browsing reddit. Not that it's something bad to do. But then, when you do not set a goal, you are bound to lose the fight, like I fucking did. It wasn't a pretty sight. I was just there wondering ""What the fuck? Why can't I have a killswitch with me? It'd be fucking simple? Why this complication? Why do I have to research on ways to fucking kill myself?"" I did this for AN ENTIRE FUCKING MONTH. One day, after not sleeping properly for the 3rd/4th day, I was up till early morning holding a knife in my hand willing myself to stab myself in the heart and be done with it. I couldn't do it. Because fuck you, there is no guarantee that it will work. Worse, if somebody finds you, you will have some fucking explaining to do. And what the heck, I do not have any fucking reason to die. I have a wonderful _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and a sister. I know they will be heartbroken but this was something I had to do. I even wrote a letter saying that I was sorry for the trouble. I was just depressed. The more I thought about it. The more stupid it felt. I then gave up on dying. I thanked _PERSON_ for keeping me alive all this time. I set about making changes in my life since then.I almost relapsed into depression when things weren't going the way that I had planned but I willed myself out of it. By fucking sheer will power. I am fucking proud of myself. I showed myself how things are supposed to be fucking done. I am happy with myself and I want to help a lot of people now. I want to tell you I've been there and that there is a way out. But that will require sheer determination and will power as that is the ONLY FUCKING WAY. I realized that and you should too. The sooner you realize the better."
klew4,35429,TheCreedOfTheCrazyOne,1316507746,Friends(?),"You'd think that during my depressive episode my friends would actually try to help me out. No. That did not happen. It's because I was under the opinion that my best friend valued our friendship as much as I valued it. Apparently I was wrong. He was like a brother. But now I realize, he was in this just for being friends with the nice guy who he could make fun of. It kind of fits the idea that I had about him sometime back. The other day, my friend asked me to shift the room for about a day or two (he and I used to share one) He didn't request it. Just asked me to do it. I was kinda pissed at being treated like that. I told him that I'd be pretty uncomfortable at the idea of shifting room and then coming back. He went beserk and just asked me to leave the accommodation. He proceeded to throw my luggage out of the room. He asked to vacate the place immediately while saying that he was the master of the room. Well. That's one fucked up experience to have. I had enough of it. I am packing bags and changing my place. I can't live in such a toxic environment.I kinda realize that maybe I don't fit in this world. I am too much of a social recluse to be any good. I am impulsive and say whatever is in my mind without thinking much about it. Sometimes I say stuff that I do not mean. Sometimes I do. So that's that. I think I am kind of destined to be alone given that I am this crazy. Not that I am worried about it. It is just kind of boring. Like the guy in ""I am Legend"" without his dog for company. Just talking to myself to maintain my peace."
ryaiy,35429,GetMotivated,1333831024,/rant,"A letter from TheCrazyOne to himself:The mind is such a fucked up thing. The moment you believe you lost the game, your mind will will you into giving up. To get over this, condition your responses. Remember that time in the gym when your body is not able to complete a set as you had planned. When you gave up on completing the set, you lost the battle. Do not give up. Persevere. Try. Try harder. Go insane. Make this a life or death situation where if you give up on yourself, you are dead. If you have given up, go angry on yourself and do the entire set again. No excuses. Never. You should never lose the battle. You are the one destined to win. But you got to will yourself into it. There is no other go. The moment you think ""I will not be able to do this"" you go into the defensive mode and all your systems shut down. All your systems. You will lose the motivation to continue. Your pains will be just that. Your conditioning will be received as an additional burden to your burdened body when it should actually be the feeling of your muscles being applied for the first time. This applies not just to a workout in the gym. It applies to everything in life. You remember that foreign language that you wanted to learn or that certification that you wanted to study for. You gave up on that. Why? You were doing good. You just needed to practice. Nothing comes without practice. Imagine a martial artist who just studied the forms. Without conditioning, the bones will shatter on application of force on a hard object. Is that what you really want? A broken, disheartened shadow of a person who had dreams? You are the crossroads now. You always are. You can either trudge along. Or just give up and become a stinking corpse - a mess for someone else to clear. Condition your mind. It can do amazing things. It can solve problems and make your fears disappear in an instant. You've been there and done that. But your mind needs to be conditioned to do that all the time. You are at the wrong side of 25. You have paranoia. Extreme paranoia. You trust no one. You are never really happy. You can't relate to the losers, that surround you, that have given up. You can't relate to the winners that have won because you have never tasted victory or achieved that satisfaction. What are you then?  Someone just waiting for a natural end to his life so that he can get on with it? Why do you give up? Why don't you trust yourself to take that winning step? Why accept defeat? Why accept the lack of victories?Wake up. Do stuff. The longer you sit still waiting for things to happen, the more moss will gather around you. It will make you feel antiquated. An out-of-place loser that never really fits anywhere. You did not choose to be here. But you are and that is because, you haven't done anything to get yourself out of this position.Don't complain that you do not have time. Make time. Stop snoring your ass off in the mornings. Wake up early and learn all the stuff that you wanted to learn. Do all the stuff that you wanted to do. There is nothing stopping you. There never was. It's all in your head. You want to do something really bad, you will find a way to help yourself out and get you of this rotting hellhole that you are in. Do not be disappointed by the lack of results. Nothing happens in a day. If you want to build a huge monument to your success, you will need to lay a strong foundation. A foundation that will not falter, waver or crumble. But it will not build itself. You will need to build it. _PERSON_-by-brick. No other way. No one else is going to help you. Nothing you read will help you. You need to realize it. Life just wants to put you down. You let it put you down, you are a loser. You fight against the odds, you are a winner. Fact. No bullshit. There will be shit ton of obstacles once you want to set things right. Face them. Never give up.  Be ruthless. Have principles. Never give up.-x-"

2b7v9y,31528,wow,1405873594,Is making an Unholy Death Knight worth it anymore if one intends to raid?,"Back in Cataclysm, my Unholy Death Knight would almost always top the DPS charts in raids and, occasionally, PvP. _PERSON_, after a long time away from WoW on my part and a series of class-breaking nerfs on Blizzard's part, I am a bit unsure as to whether or not I should attempt to level and use an Unholy DK.I adored the playstyle of the UH DK - it was one of the only classes/spec that I really wanted to get the feel of (and the only class/spec that I ever truly succeeded in). _PERSON_, however, I am worried that if I return I will not be wanted as a DPS in raids being that the build has been fairly nerfed and no longer offers truly competitive DPS (unless one is intending to compete with the tanks or healers for DPS).  So please, WoW'ers of Reddit, is the almost-uselessness associated with creating a PvE Unholy Death knight worth it?Edit:  Thanks to all of you for your help!  I have taken all of your advice into consideration, and I believe I will wait a while to see if any positive changes will be made in regards to DKs (and Unholy in particular)."

I would also like to point out that I mean no ill-will with my opinions described here, and that I actually enjoyed a great deal of the _PERSON_ series and *want* to enjoy the rest.A while back there was a discussion on this subreddit in which I suggested that there was a drop in quality of the manga a bit after the occurrence of the Eclipse.  I want to know if this belief is valid, and if not, how I should go about appreciating the rest of the series. Here's my argument.  I LOVED the Golden Age/Eclipse arc.  For quite some time, I couldn't stop myself from reading the manga - it was just so goddamn good.  Afterwards, however, my interest seemed to waver.  It was fine, at first.  The main plot/struggle was still a thing, and _PERSON_ was trying to find Casca and ensure her safety, etc.  Not much in regards to plot structure had changed.  But that changed.  Slowly but surely, I felt that things were just veering off course, and that the story no longer had any real sort of focus.  [spoilers]I mean, we jump from saving Casca from a bunch of hyper-religious crazy bastards, to befriending a young ""witch"" and the existence of extreme fantasy-like magic elements being introduced, to eventually becoming some crazy pirate adventure with _PERSON_ and crew.  The actual Griffith/_PERSON_/Casca storyline now feels only sparsely scattered over this vast realm of just... different stuff. It just seems like the plot has just lost its way, and the general tone and direction is changing to something completely different.  I don't know.  It has been a while since I last read them. Again, I mean no offense whatsoever.  I **want** to enjoy the rest of the series, but I think that either I or the manga has lost that original direction somewhere in the process of me reading it. ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^am ^^^^^^also ^^^^^^half ^^^^^^asleep ^^^^^^so ^^^^^^please ^^^^^^forgive ^^^^^^me ^^^^^^if  ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^sound ^^^^^^like ^^^^^^an _PERSON_."

Failure has corrupted me.  Sadness has taken me.  I have finally been raped by the words of others, after years of remaining somewhat resolute.  I have lost those that I hold closest. In short, without going too far into my story - for the sake of time - I am sad, lonely, and I have no interest in living anymore.-I hit the snooze button again at this point-I have, for quite some time, been ambivalent towards the idea of death.  It's a scary prospect, not living anymore.  Through our existence, we have only known one thing, and that's life. It's what's familiar to us, and we are understandably scared of just not ""being"" anymore. I had, up until recently, not cared whether I lived or died.  I would be curious as to whether the large truck next to me on the road would suddenly swerve into my lane, throwing me off into the thick wooded area to my other side.  I had a nightmare about this once, I remember ,during better times, and it frightened me.  I didn't want to die.  I didn't want to have those last few seconds of struggle and confusion, leading to that nothingness.  I had things, people to live for. _PERSON_, I only have obligations.  My mind is diseased, unable to take happiness, knowing that it will eventually be taken from me, leaving a larger hole than the space that happiness once occupied. My heart is riddled with such holes, and I have no interest in forming any more.  I don't want to take the effort living up to the expectations of me. I simply can't, no matter how hard I try.  I have to put on a face - a mask - to hide the fact that I'm despairing so that others don't feel uncomfortable around me (this mask has since fallen off - apathy wins out again). Without being religious, I am a very morally-obsessed person.  I've studied more philosophy and psychology than anyone else I know.  I think it is this reason, as well as my own cowardice, that I am still here.  I can't bear the thought of leaving such a hole - as I have mentioned earlier - in the lives and hearts of others.  I can't seek treatment (though I have my personal objections against this, though probably illogical) because my parents would think that they are failures - that I am (as I am) a sick, depressed child that they created and led down this path (as I am not - this is my own doing). For the very same reasons and more, I cannot kill myself normally.  My friends - as few as they are - would hate themselves for ignoring the signs (or so I hope they would.  I don't know for certain), my parents for their ""failure"", the people I interact with every day for the fact that they could have tried (most likely without success, but I don't know) to make things better. As such, I have flirted with the idea of making it seem like an accident.  I can try to put on that happy mask again, go about living my life for another few months (and oh I can hardly bear that thought), and end up driving under the influence in my rural neighborhood (less chance of hurting someone else) and hitting some tree, most likely (the uncertainty of this example kills me) causing my death.  Then I'm dead just because I'm an idiot.  My parents have told me a thousand times to never drink and drive.  My friends do not know me to ever drink, so they would not blame themselves for not stopping such an occurrence.   Then again, I am a coward.  I don't think I'll do it. I want to, though.  Each day is so full of pain. I might edit this later.  I'll probably delete it eventually."

I like how it's a convertible laptop, the specs seem alright - better than my previous laptop, for the most part - but I'm worried about how well it will be able to handle the games that I normally play. I mean, I don't need any sort of 60 FPS crazy stuff, but I want them (Dark Souls 2 specifically) to play somewhat smoothly on the lowest graphics settings. I don't know much about computer hardware, so I don't know for certain if this one can handle it, but I'd assume it's probable. Another concern is the fact that it's also a tablet; I mean, that's one of the coolest things I've come across on my search for an affordable laptop, but I'm not certain how easy it is to take care of the thing - especially when it comes to the common problem of dropping them, and cracking the screen, etc.  I couldn't find any sort of protection device online, but the place I'm buying it from offers one-year accidental damage protection, which is sort of a plus. ----------------------My thanks go eternally to whoever invested enough of their time to help me out with this. I really appreciate it, kind _PERSON_)."

p14rq,35048,mylittlepony,1327798687,The Secret Life of the American Brony,"(I didn't write this, but my friend wrote it for a speech. I thought I'd share)Introduction:It's Saturday morning; nine o'clock. You're awake because, come on, who has time to sleep these days. You have choices pertaining to early morning entertainment: put in a DVD, watch re-runs of 'Home Improvement'...or, if you're really feeling adventurous, read.Let's face it—life is hard. Quality entertainment, specifically good television shows, are limited these days. But luckily for us, there a few jewels left, attempting to shine through the fog of unrealistic reality shows and cup-cake dramas._PERSON_ is Magic is one of these jewels.And it is my life.You've probably heard of the show; heck, just turn on your internet browser and watch the pony-fandom explode right in front of you. According to idsnews.com, pony songs, videos, and fan-fictions are taking the web by storm, with some fan-made stories reaching lengths as long as 3,000 pages! Clearly, the show has a cult following. But the thought of actually watching the thing? Manning up, sitting down in front of your flat-screen, and actually enduring the entire 20 minutes of pony-related antics?It sounds silly, and I will admit it.But I highly recommend doing so._PERSON_ is Magic is more than your stereotypical little-kid television program. It contains not only humor, charm, and an undeniable 'cute-factor', but it honestly makes you feel better about yourself. Warm and happy, like a marshmallow roasted to perfection._PERSON_? Yes. But true? Absolutely.  Problem:If I could dive into the very depths of your minds, I bet your thoughts would go a little something like this:“Ponies? How lame can you get? I swear, this man's such a weirdo...”Unfortunately, if you are thinking this very thing, you are within the majority. Although I am a women (don't let the hair fool you), many people see fans of My Little Pony to be 'nerds', 'dorks', and—let's not forget–'virgins'. In fact, when I first came out to one of my good friends as being a brony (the name given to MLP:FIM fans), he looked at me with a mixture of disgust and something I can only describe as utter disappointment.“Get away.” He joked, but the terror of catching my lameness was still present in his eyes.Such reactions have caused some bronies to become 'closet cases', hiding their love for the show for fear of ridicule. Others refuse to give the show a try, due to the My Little Pony stigmas Hasbro has created for itself. The first My Little Pony television show debuted on September 15th, 1986. It was entitled “My Little Pony N' Friends”, and was created purely for the merchandising of the Hasbro My Little Pony toys. It had dull writing and generic female characters, like many of the shows in the 80s with a focus audience of girls aged 6-12. Since then, there have been three additional Hasbro pony shows, also known as 'generations'. With each generation, new characters were added, animation evolved, and writing styles changed drastically. But the goal was always the same: sell the toys.That is, until Generation 4 was introduced.And mastermind _PERSON_ took things into her own hands. Solution:You've probably watched shows that _PERSON_ has been a part of, '_PERSON_'s Home for Imaginary Friends' and 'The Powerpuff Girls' to name a few. In fact, she's married to animator _PERSON_, the creator of both popular cartoons, according to tvtropes.com. She had also worked as an animator and story board artist for 'The Iron Giant' and is, in a quote from McCracken himself, “The real life _PERSON_ _PERSON_.”Talented and sick of the sexist stereotypes present in many girl-focused cartoon shows, _PERSON_ set off on a mission to create a new type of pony-based and toy-merchandising TV series. One with humor, pop-culture references, and an appeal that defies both sex and gender.A quote from _PERSON_, courtesy of toonzone.com, _PERSON_ didn't create this show for little girls, I created it for little girls and their parents--including male parents. It only stands to reason that adult animation fans without children may like it, too.The belief that boys shouldn't be interested in girl things is the main reason there's hardly anything decent for girls in animation--- or almost any media, for that matter. It's a backwards, sexist, outdated attitude.”With these principals in mind, the new My Little Pony was born, chock-full of clever humor, pop-culture references, and interesting and well developed characters. I can not stress how important thought-out characters are in order to create a truly good...well, anything. Sure, a pretty looking pony might satisfy a seven-year-old, but we older fans enjoy the characters for deeper reasons; although, admittedly, those ponies are pretty cute. Their personalities only add to that charm, however, whether it be bold, brave, and cheeky _PERSON_, shy, kind and caring Fluttershy, or even _PERSON_—the main pony, who is known across Equestria for her nerdiness and organization skills. Apple-bucking, “ye-haw” hollerin' AppleJack, Party-loving and mentally unstable _PERSON_, and the dramatic fashonista Rarity round off the “Mane Six”, not including _PERSON_'s faithful assistant/slave Spike the Baby Dragon. Other characters—such as royal sisters _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, googly-eyed and ditzy _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, Dr. _PERSON_, Apple Bloom, Sweetie Bell, _PERSON_, and the fan-favorited 'background ponies', characters who hardly speak but appear in scenes quite frequently—create a fun and diverse population, all of which are just trying to get along in this crazy, PonyVille world.  Visualization:You hear everyday about the violence and strife the world is currently under, but few ways to counteract said violence. Now don't get me wrong; I am not implying that My Little Pony is the solution to world peace (although if anyone can accomplish such a feat, Fluttershy would be the one to do it). But while some things may contribute to the hostility, I doubt a show about love, kindness, and the magic of friendship could. The show is not just pure silliness; because it is, in general, created for little kids, the series is loaded with good morals. They are things we teenagers and young adults have been aware of for many years, but a little refresher is always nice; and besides, the show has other redeeming qualities. Teendepression.org states that over 20% of teenagers will experience depression before reaching their young adult years. I, unfortunately, am a part of that 20%. A simple TV show will not cure this, and I know it. But it's worth mentioning that watching the show has helped maintain my depression symptoms, and has the power to significantly lift my mood.Imagine a world where everyone lives by _PERSON_'s words of wisdom; Fluttershy's kindness or _PERSON_'s song lyrics. It would not only be a world of pony lovers, but a world of acceptance.Of friendship.Of magic.  Conclusion:So maybe you'll go online now, and search for Season One, Episode One, of MLP:FIM. Or maybe not. Quite frankly, it's all up to you, and the world will not end if you do not give the show a chance. But if you're like me, desperately searching for a hint of real talent or amusement in this Jersey Shore, _PERSON_ world, then it certainty wouldn't hurt you to do so. I promise you, the second you catch a glimpse of Fluttershy's crippling shyness or _PERSON_'s tom-boy, can-do attitude, you will fall in love.I've been a brony since June now, caught in a Pony-filled world of wonderment.And it's a good place to be."

Now, if this happened millions of original submissions would be made. Out of these millions of submissions Nintendo pick 100 and provide the necessary stats and traits etc... The winners creations get chosen get a free copy and an artist credit. And with all the leftovers Nintendo would have plenty of ideas to work with in future versions. (Thoughts?)"

I ignored it but i ripped the paper the shreds after asking a few questions and being thankful. Threw it in the bin.A few days later something very wierd happened around me. Lights would at times flicker and not anywhere else. Papers that are put on the wall by glue or something would suddenly just rip off. A  more days later, when i tried to sleep i felt something touch my stomach with a finger. Just pointing at it. I could feel a finger touching my skin and it was no dream. I felt alarmed. Then this happened two times.I would fall into a peaceful mood of sleep. Then suddenly the voices would just stop and every noise stopped for a second and felt a sense of danger. That happened twice.

Personality: Has alot of respect over others and prefers not to cause a chaos in the city, often friendly and would not even bother to go angry even if forced to be. Conduit: _PERSON_. _PERSON_ darts: Fire a barrage of bricks towards the victimGrenade - Shrapnel brick, a hollow shaped brick with shrapnel in it upon contact it explodes and spits/throws shrapnel everywhere. _PERSON_ jump, not really a jump but he extends the ground he's on to create a pillar of a brick to get to his location.(Imagine the Pillar moving through the ground and extending.)_PERSON_ _PERSON_ - A javelin that does tonnes of damage to anything brick and acts as a javelin weapon when it dosen't. _PERSON_ bomb (Karma bomb) Kinda like brick darts but fires sphere shaped bricks towards the victim and with each hit the brick starts to build up  and eventually form a prison. Giving me the choice of either condensing it or unleashe them and create a jail. Backstory: Born in France and then moved to Seattle at an later date.  He's discovered his powers by the age of 12, and could control it due to it not having much agressive use and it would go well with his personality. And with that he has been living off of the streets and bounty hunting which would be a big job for a little brat for him and to ensure he won't die the boy only went after those who had a lower bounty and weren't much of a threat the police didin't handle. Yes... even by a low age he has had a great sense of justice and putting his life before others. Shortly after he met a odd figuire of a teacher who had a boy under his teachings with caesium powers along with his brick powers and took him under the teaching.  As one day at age 18 he'd go into another fight but this time it would be far more dangerous. The criminals were paid to lure him to the alley for recruitment by the DUP. The criminals were short work as he had made the prison while  they were talking showing he won't talk and do nothing but instead does something whenever it's needed. As he would meet one of the DUP's recruiters they'd ask him to join them due to his strong sense of justice and been cleaning the streets of lowly people due to the higher ones being much too dangerous.   With those words he heard he'd agree gladly and bring himself to the DUP for more training of his powers. At the final stage of his being as a recruited person he'd be a full fledged conduit soldier with his experience of his own powers.

Orbs quickly erupted from the boy's back much to the pain. The teen knelt as the orbs slowly started to drain power from him. The villagers saw this as an opprotunity to murder him.

However, it's still been difficult to do my assignments (not AS difficult) and I've still been nervous about going to class (not AS _PERSON_ profs have given extensions and disability services offered me a place to study in their office.

Keep in mind that it's the depression that's been getting in the way of my assignments.Thank you."

1kw5pp,46091,TwoXChromosomes,1377198827,My mom is emotionally abusive &amp; I need some help.,"Hi all. I'm just looking for a bit of support and insight here. My mom has bipolar disorder pretty severely. She's always blaming everything really mean she does on her bipolar. I have bipolar too but I take responsibility for my actions. She constantly calls me a horrible person, or tells me I ruin things, or tells me I'm lazy and will never get a job when I graduate college. The worst part about this is that she completely denies everything she said when I tell her that it was hurtful. This really makes me feel like she doesn't care. Another thing she does is scream really loud and stomp on the floor. We live in an apartment building and when she does these things, I remind her that the neighbors are probably annoyed. She says she doesn't care, but then if the neighbors are loud she starts screaming about how disrespectful they are. She always blows things way out of proportion and has a weird cyclical view of everything. That is probably one of the more difficult parts to deal with. By this, I mean that she will tell me option A and option B, but either one I pick is apparently wrong. There are NO right answers to some of her questions or ""orders."" She's also always changing ""rules"" without telling me then getting mad when I break said rule. For example, she used to leave the sugar by the coffee maker and one day I put it there and she started yelling at me and telling me it goes in the cabinet now because I'm stupid and always get water from the sink into the sugar container. Fine, move the sugar container, but tell me about it and don't freak out at me over nothing. Another rather annoying thing she does is talk about how ""busy"" she is. She gets disability and literally just plays computer games all day. She gets mad if I tell her she's being lazy, and she always tells me I'm much lazier than she is. I'm a full-time college student with a part-time job... I'm NOT lazy. I just really hate the fact that my mom acts like an immature young teenager. I feel like I am so much more mature than her, which is ridiculous. Also, she gets really close to being physically abusive. Recently, she tried to punch me, but stopped about an inch from my face. I was really terrified. She also told me that she would punch me if I was really bothering her (but of course she denied this later). Super messed up. I'll probably be living with her until I graduate from college (about 4 more semesters). I don't really have anywhere else to go. The only two places I have to go would be my boyfriend's house (but he lives with his semi-abusive aunt who is kicking him out in a year anyway), and my grandpa's house. I lived with my grandpa for a few months but I was not comfortable at all. The only plus side of living with my mom is that she understands my depression &amp; anxiety better than other people like my grandpa and other family members. I just want some support and some coping mechanisms for living with my mom. I live really close to my school and am hoping to spend most of my time there starting in September. But when I have to be at home I want to know what to do. Also, my mom isn't always like this. Occasionally she is nice for a day or two, but always ends up going back to being manic. Thanks.Edit: Just a little while ago, I asked her if I could move the kitchen utensils a little bit closer to the front of the top of the fridge so that I could reach them better (she is much taller than me). She starts freaking out about it and screaming literally at the top of her lungs about the utensils falling if I move them any closer. This is completely untrue. She does things like this all the time and I swear she just wants to make my life more difficult.Please be kind to me when replying."

1njeen,46091,TwoXChromosomes,1380662299,Question about periods &amp; implant.,"I have had the nexplanon implant for about 6-7 months now (it's a little plastic rod inserted into my arm). For the first 4 months or so I got my period normally. My doctors were really surprised when I told them this because apparently most peoples' periods stop on the nexplanon. Then my period randomly stopped. I haven't had it for 2 months. I've taken a lot of pregnancy tests at different times and I'm not pregnant. I've just been assuming that it is a result of my birth control, but then I read a post about taking it more seriously if you have been missing your period. Is it possible for my period to go away due to my bc even after having it for 4 months? I should probably go to my obgyn again but I feel like I go into my doctors' offices all the time for various symptoms and I worry that they are judging me for going in a lot. Silly, I know. I figured I'd ask here first and see what I get for answers. Please be kind! Thank you."

I have a couple hundred dollars coming to me soon and I am hoping to update my makeup and hair supplies. I do have some makeup and hair supplies but they are all from drugstores and aren't anything fancy. I do really like the ""Covergirl lashblast fusion"" mascara I have but the other makeup I have doesn't work so well. For hair stuff, I have some dry shampoo and de-frizzing serum as well as a hair straightener (wet2straight) but I would like better supplies. My face breaks out easily and is rather pale and sensitive. I do have a bit of pinkness/redness on my face. My hair is extremely thick, which is the main problem I have with it. I have straightened it before but it takes HOURS with the current straightener I have. I haven't been able to find any serums for my hair that work well at keeping it looking nice, so I mostly just wear it up just so it's out of the way. Also, my hair is a bit wavy. It's currently pretty short (up to my shoulders) but I would like to grow it longer.So do any of you ladies have any advice for someone basically JUST starting to actively look feminine?

I am okay with this and would like to explore the world, but I want a time limit set on it, like 2 years or so, then we could come back to the states and go for master's degrees. I feel like I would miss my family a lot and am always worried about my mom's cancer returning, so that's why I don't want to go for an extended period of time.He's not necessarily against this idea, but he doesn't like the idea of time limits being set on things. He also wants to pursue monkhood for a period of time, which I am all for, but again, he's not keen on setting a time limit for it.We really love each other, but it's really hard to come up with a compromise. We're currently on a ""break"" for the next week or so while we try to sort out these issues that have been going on.I'm not sure what to do. I wish he could just accept coming up with a compromise because I think that's the only way this will work.

She is the only parent we grew up with.EDIT: Also, what can I expect?UPDATE: My mom apparently walked out on the doctor when he told her the news, so she really doesn't know how long she has, and a year was apparently just a guess on her part. Kind of mad about that. But she's going to go back to the doctor and figure it out. If she has the most common type, the 5 year survival rate is 80% with treatment. So she's been saying she's going to talk to her doctor about treatments too. Annoyed with her, but happy that all happened. :)"
1jaag1,5582,TeraOnline,1375116424,Need some people to start playing with and eventually maybe start a guild with! VoT server,"Hello people of Reddit. I'm a relatively new player with Tera and I've made a couple of different characters and stuff. But I can't really find anyone that I can consistently play with. It seems like every single person I meet in the game is Brazilian and doesn't really know much English. Anyways, I need people to play with, and I would really be interested in starting my own guild with a few others eventually once I have gotten to around lvl 60. I've tried and played pretty much each of the classes, and I've decided to play support classes like the Priest and the _PERSON_ (Both of which are currently just over lvl 10). So if anyone else wants to play, whether they are a new player like me or not, just let me know on this thread and we'll try to play!"

When I want to “do something for myself” I always look at “female only”. I am attracted to guys hence the boyfriend and all. I guess being raised in the south I have always tried to ignore how I feel about being sexual attracted to women bc my family is CRAZY religious. I do not know if this qualifies me a bi-sexual or not (I am pretty sure it does). I have never found a woman that I wanted to be with in a relationship. I just know that I tend to women and men sexually attractive. There is quite a good bit of sigma living in the southern states. Gosh, that’s all I need to be a bi-sexual atheist living in the South. I wish that I could tell others but it is hard. I do not want to be a target, but a the same time I do not want to hide for my beliefs as bisexual and an atheist. By the way, my bf is cool with it… in fact he really likes it … shock shock. I know who I am, I guess I wanted to vent. I am quite aware that there are many others who are in a much worse situation than myself."
33bg6c,5582,saplings,1429588428,so I have just started smoking.. basically,
34ckp5,5582,saplings,1430358316,"How weed has changed my life for the better, I just wanted to share [Discussion]","Everyday, I would go home worrying (anxiety, social and by myself). I couldn’t be happy. I used to think it was because I couldn’t be alone. But that’s simply not true. The truth is I couldn’t stand to not be distracted from my worries. Nothing I could do would slow things down in my head. When I was a child, it was rough in general, so my mother at the time had me put on a bunch of meds for ADHD. Those drugs made me slow and flat. I have always been an open individual, so I have tried everything to stop the anxiety. I tried such things as mediation, TV, video games, friends, writing and even doctors. Recently, I went through a break up (it was decision to do so, we ended on good terms) and I learned that had the hardest time being alone. It was because I couldn’t slow things do enough to rationalize anything. I couldn’t focus with 5,000 thoughts in my head, long enough to solve/rationalize a problem. So things would spiral into a massive black hole of depression. Now when I come home I smoke and just feel relaxed (sit outside in nature) chill out, and slow down. I do not think I have EVER been able to do this before. _PERSON_ does not make me happy, but what it does do is allow me slow down and think. Think about what really matters in life. What I want out of life and chill the fuck out. I had a one bad fucking childhood and if I can use some harmless weed to as a catalyst for me to relax and put things in perspective than I will. (not to say I don’t use it for fun every once in while haha). Stay high and happy folks! I just wanted to share my story to those who can possibly appreciate. Sorry for any grammar errors, I typed it up quickly."

I recently have been ex-communicated by my family because they found my journal and let's just say for the most part they aren't a fan of my opinions on their most recent actions towards me. I'm looking to rebuild my life; without them and I figure a new circle of friends is a great start. A bit more about me; I enjoy cooking, travel, photography, learning new things, pranks, bad humor, puns, sarcasm, _PERSON_ movies, House MD, Lie to Me, Rookie Blue, Flashpoint, music of most genres, Green Day (was raised on the stuff), shitty bro comedies, staying up late with my friends and walking around AND so much more. I just really would like to meet people and see if friendships come through. Preferred methods of talking would be texting (I have international texting, so get at me world.) and Skype when possible.

There are several different things that make up a good lawyer.but to make things short and sweet, below is a link to an article in Forbes that has a pretty simple and straight forward guide to finding a good lawyer.www.forbes.com/sites/financialfinesse/2011/10/05/how-to-find-a-good-lawyer-when-you-really-need-one/It's also worth mentioning, in the wiki there is information on referrals to lawyers in Canada, the USA, and the UK.

Both of their names are on it, so in order to access it I need both of their signatures.If I were not several thousand kilometers away working this wouldn't be an issue, but I'm clearly not in the position to get this done myself.This is where the parents come in, they do not cooperate. they don't communicate or anything of the sort, even if its paramount to the wellbeing of their children. I sent the form to my father, however he refuses to cooperate in getting my mother to sign the paper. I sent it to him first because he has the means of getting the paper signed and faxed to the appropriate office quickly. However, he is refusing to be civil long enough to go spend all of two minutes getting the paper signed by my mother, his reasoning being ""she is the biggest regret in my life, I don't want to talk to her.""When I broached the subject with my mother, she refuses to email him to get the ball rolling on getting this done. I've both asked her politely and told her bluntly to stop pissing around with this because it's important, yet she still resists attempting to talk to him because she is sure its my problem not hers. They are both acting like stubborn 12 year olds refusing to cooperate with each other. I feel like I've said all I can say to them in order to get this done.According to the RESP holder for security reasons I cannot have them send it separate forms, everything must be on the one paper, making their interaction necessary.side note: there's the strong possibility my father is an N as he has clear Golden Children and I am the scape goat. Could this have anything to do with his refusal to get this small task done?TL;DR: my parents should be in day care."

Being a smoker myself, I took one look at those and thought nope and continued on my merry way.Then along came into a kik group I was a part of, the guest of honor himself. Along with him came his vaporiser. A curious device really, it looked a lot different from the ones I've seen in the past.He enlightened the group with his ecig gospel and I was fairly intrigued. The more he talked, the more interested I found myself in this device.So I bought one, my first device was a tiny Atmos Olé, it wasn't fancy, it wasn't the best, but it was mine. This ladies and gentleman is how I got into vaping.Time went on and I learned more about the lifestyle fr our guest of honor. I learned about juices and their make up, I learned about the components of the vape, I learned the basics of what makes up a good vape, and this subreddit. let's just say I learned a fair bit.it was with the input of this wise vaper that I made my next purchase, a KangerTech subox mini. Just today actually. With the drowning death of _PERSON_ it was time. I can't be more thrilled with it, and the whole reason I ended up vaping and with this is device is because of /u/I_eat_zombies.So with that a toast and a puff to my friend and a true aficionado of the vape /u/i_eat_zombiesThank you for being a  friend and putting up with my endless questions about vaping.Vape on.edit:  the olé: www.vapepen.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Atmos-Ole-Pic71-462x392.jpg"
1qh59c,2198,selfharm,1384284380,What am I?,"Hello everyone - I've checked out this subreddit sometimes and it looks like a great community. I want to ask if I really am a cutter or not. I used to cut when I was 15 to maybe 17 and I still have scars from it, though they've faded to almost nothing (I'm 23 now). Even when I did it more, I never cut too deep... yes, it bled, but it's not quite like what I've seen here. I've also seen some people say they do 20 cuts in one spot, whereas I would only do 5 - 10, tops. Now, I only cut myself once at a time... I usually cut across my arm a few times in the same spot, sometimes I've done it on my hand in an impulsive moment at work, but it just looks like I cut my hand on something. My cuts still bleed a bit (they're not dripping in blood), but I wait until they heal before I do another one.Am I considered a cutter? I crave it more, but I restrain myself because I don't want my boyfriend to ask any questions... I'm pretty sure he knows but I lie every time and say I cut myself on something. Take yesterday for example, I cut myself twice in the same spot, then freaked out because I don't want to be a cutter, and then I stopped. Later in the night my boyfriend was SUPER attentive to me, more so than usual, and he asked what happened but I lied and said that I rubbed up against the corner of the cupboard. AND, that's not even remotely plausible because the cut is straight across and our cupboards aren't even kind of sharp, but I don't know how to lie and I panicked. The thing is, if he asks again, can I just say that sometimes I cut myself, but I'm not a cutter? Because I don't feel like I am. I just cut myself sometimes but it's not deep or often, so it's not the same thing. Thoughts?"

Can you imagine how great that would be? I could have so many injuries on my body, maybe a broken bone or two, cuts and bruises everywhere, and it wouldn't be my fucking fault!But the greatest thing is, I wouldn't have to crave cutting myself so much because I would be cut up. Furthermore, if I did cut, everyone would just assume it was from the accident (if I did it randomly enough). So with terrible weather coming in, I drove home on the highway that has the most deaths per year in North America... and it was fucking sunny the whole way home. I won't drive erratically, I would put myself in harms way, I won't tailgate, speed too much, or put anyone else in harm's way...

I have covered countless people's shifts, worked two positions at once, stayed late, come in early (usually once a week). In fact, tomorrow I'm going in for 4 hours even though I booked it off months ago because someone begged me to cover it so she can go on a field trip with her son.Today I asked someone to come in early so I could go to the Big Sister dinner with my Little Sister (through the Big Sisters program). I asked her weeks ago, she agreed - one hour early. Checked last week, no problems. Asked yesterday - yep, she's fine. Shows up a fucking hour late today. Fuck this. Now I'm running an hour late to an underprivileged 12 year old? That kid won't understand why I'm late, all she knows is I'm late. Then, when she comes in, she's talking to me about her day.

Then, I find out that my Dad doesn't want to take me out for a celebratory dinner to celebrate my graduation from university because ""there aren't enough people to celebrate"". What in the actual fuck? I have spent years of my life studying and working hard to graduate. I have been so stressed out this year trying to get everything done, work, get my mom to chemo, etc., and NO ONE wants to celebrate my ONE accomplishment? Any idea how much time we spend talking about my sister's school? Fun fact: she dropped out of university years ago and is going back to school now... I guess that's more of an accomplishment than graduating. So. Today I came home in a rush, pissed off as fucking hell, and I cut myself. Deep. Hard. It felt fucking wonderful.  My boyfriend hasn't seen it yet (I haven't even had the chance to look since getting home).  It'll be hard to continue lying about it and I feel guilty I did it now, but I'm also so goddamn glad it's there. I can touch it and feel relief when I'm stressed.

1x3nqn,2198,Anxiety,1391623880,Panic attack while you sleep?,"So yesterday I had a rough day and then guess what? _PERSON_, get my first speeding ticket when driving home from work. I don't know why, but it bothers me so much. Every mistake I make when driving does.I got into an accident around this time last year, where, being a goddamn idiot, I came into a parking spot too fast and dinged the car next to me. (I know, I know, I couldn't be anymore useless). Anyways, I had a dream last night where I'm driving and then I drive off road with people in the car... kinda. First, I'm following someone out of the parking lot and I almost rear end them and I can feel the panic you'd naturally feel if you got too close to someone while actually driving a car. Then, it's hard to explain but basically, there was a drop of 500 feet and there was a robot to take your car down and if you didn't do it well, you just fell. And guess who didn't take the robot road? I woke up from the dream feeling dizzy as all fuck. Like, monster spins if I had been drinking, except I hadn't had a drop of alcohol. I've also had vertigo before and this was different. I was also sweaty, out of breath and just felt... off. Does anyone know if I had a mild panic attack in my dream? Is that even a thing? What else could it have been?"

1yvcvg,2198,Anxiety,1393308384,Is it inappropriate to ask my doctor to consider a medication that might help me lose weight?,"Hi /r/anxiety! After years of denial, I'm FINALLY addressing my anxiety issues with the doctor tomorrow. I've finally come to terms with the fact that I need meds...for whatever reason it bothers me greatly to go on meds. I've studied psychology (just graduated with a degree in it, actually) and I know anxiety can be the same thing as diabetes; both can be manageable with no medication, but sometimes meds are necessary. No idea why it bugs me, but it does.Anyways, I'm fat as fuck and part of my anxiety comes from that. I hate it. I'm terrified that any medication I go on will make me gain weight. Is it highly inappropriate to ask the doctor to keep that in mind when prescribing me something?   Any advice you can provide would be great, thanks!"

Sure, I graduated from university recently and everyone acts like it's some huge fucking accomplishment, but is it really? So many people graduate from university. It's not like it's absolutely impossible. I've let my anxiety and depression take over my life. I finally got help for it and went on meds and my anxiety feels better, but my depression feels worse. Today is your birthday and I've done fucking nothing. I went and spent $25.00 on cake supplies and for fucking what? I think I can bake, but I fucking suck at it. But of course, I'm going to have to lie and say everything is okay because I can't bring you down on your birthday. Sure as fuck can't let you see that I cut myself on your birthday either. Caved for the first time in months because I truly feel like an epic fucking failure. I offer you nothing. I offer the world nothing.

28ull0,2198,depression,1403501177,Seeking advice on antidepressants...has this happened to you?,"I'm not seeking medical advice here. I know I need to go talk to my doctor, it's just not that possible right now to get there so I'm hoping to see if anyone has ever experienced this. Anyways, I've been on cipralex for months now, mainly for anxiety but also to lighten the depression. Started on 10mg in February, didn't feel it was successful so we upped it to 20mg two months later. I take it everyday within a two hour time frame, without fail.After we upped my dose I felt better for a while... more motivated. But then I started to slip back into my depression. But then my anxiety started coming back within the last week. Attacks, general anxiety, and depression symptoms have worsened. It's all just seemed so sudden. It's like everyday I decline more and more and feel more hopeless with every passing day.Has anyone else experienced this while on an antidepressant? Is this something to be concerned about?TL;DR - anxiety/depression worsen quickly after months on an antidepressant."

2bv6hp,2198,SuicideWatch,1406477835,"Large rant of suicidal thoughts, beware! **Not in danger, please read other people's real posts first!!!!","First, let me start by saying that I'm trained in both crisis and suicide intervention. I know all the tricks of the trade, because I use them on people. Not saying that to be a jackass, just saying you can skip the formalities with me... I really just need to write these thoughts down, not have people like me go through the intervention steps :) Second, I'm not in any urgent danger. While I do have a plan, I haven't given away any items, nor do I have serious intent to kill myself... I really just need to share my emerging suicidal thoughts with someone... a stranger who doesn't know me.Anyways, on to the good stuff. I am such a pathetic piece of shit, it's unreal. I don't deserve to live. I know that if I killed myself, the world would be a better place for it. I bet you my parents and sister would cry for a bit, but they'd get over it pretty fast. Who knows if my brother would even show up for the funeral. My boyfriend may be a little sad, but at least this way he can find someone better. He deserves so much more than me. Did I mention how big of a piece of shit I am?I think about suicide as an outlet, not as an action plan, but it's becoming more and more frequent. I've decided that I'd take some pills and go to a park some where. My only worry is that some fragile person would find me dead and they'd be traumatized for life. However, I don't want to do it where any family members could find me.Of course, I could never go through with it. Who would drive my mother to and from her chemo? Not my brother or sister, that's for sure. I swear, if she didn't have cancer, I'd be dead. But I know I can't kill myself because then she'd be fucked. And don't let this fool you into thinking, ""you take care of your mother? You ARE a good person!"" Nope. Still a total piece of shit. I don't deserve happiness, I don't deserve anyone... I deserve to die. And I'm a little pissed that I can't kill myself. Now, if a horrible car accident happened that a) wasn't my fault and b) killed me, but didn't horribly traumatize the driver of the other car, I'd be pretty okay with that. Anyways, that's it. I didn't know where else to post. I'm sorry if it was the wrong place."

29e2st,37948,OkCupid,1404048987,Sexual health talk?,"In light of previously posted ""mayo shooting hot dog gun"" debacle. I'm curious about what ""normal"" dating aged people's behavior around ""the sexual history/ health"" talk is. I've been out of the dating pool for at least ten years and even before that I was certainly no Casanova when I did date. Now, I've been hanging out with a bunch of new age, conscious lifestyle, hippy type people in San Diego and they do a lot of talking about what's appropriate and what should be brought up in new relationships, in relation to ""the talk"". Such as: 1. Date of last STD test2. What was tested for3. What were the results of said test   3a. If positive result indicated, is the condition now treated and when was the last signs of active symptom-ology?4. Sexual history since last test..including protected or not info.5. Relationship ""agreements""- many of said hippies are ""polyamorous"" or have open relationships or apparently even fwb..what rules and what ""fluid bonding"" is to be followed in regards to those agreements? 6. Likes/ dis-likes in regards to activities ""in bed"". These are expected (in that community) to be talks that are had before anyone starts to disrobe or anyone is feeling lusty, precisely so the urge to say whatever gets the honey pot will be minimized. This is the adult way to have a relationship is how this community puts it. I figured it's just me and that I didn't know because I've been out of dating for so long.. I've asked them if they ask for written proof of said STD test and was given the response ""if you can't trust the person you're having sex with enough to tell you the truth when asked directly, should you be having sex with them?"", answer. I find this questionable, because it seems that first impressions can be wrong.....and I'm freaked out at how disease ridden the world seems to be.. bunch of two legged petri-dishes walking around growing super bugs in their coochies... idk... I've not been with anyone in quite a while, so I'm not sure. Also, does no one else use ""Nookist.com"" to track their risk profile in regards to std's?? I've mentioned it here and was told it was weird to track something like that. Of course I mentioned it regarding using it to track other aspects of my sex life, but it's actual purpose is std risk tracking. edits: structure and an incomplete thought.."
2afx9i,37948,Divorce,1405099768,"I know I'm to blame....but I really hoped we could reconcile..I tried, but she never looked back once she walked....(so sorry it's a novella)","tldr: whhaaaa wahhhhahh  waaaahhha... I explain in far to much detail, my divorce and how she's moved on and I feel like I'm being divorced again....AND I hurt like crazy right now.. like crazy. I can see we had issues in our marriage....looking back, I want to believe we could have worked through them though. Because I'm trying to embrace my faults, I see that entering the relationship, I should have been more direct in how I wanted to live. The job I hate and have always hated, I could have had the balls to quit because I had found someone I enjoyed spending time with. I could have been that mature of a man. But I wasn't.... I thought she liked that I made more than anyone else in either of our families. She enjoyed the Lexus.... the ability to buy a outrageously overpriced condo in San Diego in 2006, the top of the real estate bubble. For a poor boy from the South who had been in a trailer park abusing himself with whatever white trash drugs he could find... I had done good and we could be proud. Except for the porn and my sexual history, and both of our leaning to depression and isolation... I pass the time ""getting high""..still. Just like I did when I was twenty, just instead of literal drugs, it was more and more grotesque images and more and more perverse porn...it got really bad when I found 4chan. The shock of seeing all those images releases adrenaline and the masturbation releases the opiates... what a great high. Then, in 2010, my company had a project in Singapore which would then go to Angola, Africa for several years. The money was even better, we were going to be able to get out of debt in no time. I worked 28 days on and 28 days off... it was challenging at times with the party culture the vast majority of my coworkers kept up....I went from being around ""quite"", churchgoing southern boys back home, to a bunch of techno clubbing, hard drinking, atheist Brits... The middle of 2011 the company offered us three times our already substantial salary to stay straight through 5-6 months in order to finish the project on schedule. Looking back, I should have told her to take the semester off of her PhD program and come live with me in Singapore...but I didn't. The porn continued of course, getting worse and worse.... she always hated it. As soon as she found the first really perverse folder of pics and website saved...she hated it and was sure I was wired up wrong. She actually had a dream one night about some particularly dark porn, she told me the dream, I lied...she mentioned it again and said it was nagging her...snooped and found it. She was probably right about not being wired right. While in Singapore, I stayed out of the legalized prostitution clubs, mostly. I did bring company back with me twice...the second time I had spent all my money on drinks so I wasn't able to complete that... but the intent was there. Still...that would have been survivable. My wife came out for a week and hated it....we had discussed her coming out at the end of the 5.5 months and us taking a tour of Asia for a month...we were both excited about it, until she got to Asia. _PERSON_ she'd never go back..didn't like the heat or the humidity or bla bla...  wasn't going back. I still had about 1.5-2 months left of my time there to do.... Without the chance of her ever being there to catch me.... I don't know the ""logic"" that I flipped or twisted or rationalized in order to get ok with what happened next. I ended up being assigned to work with an irish engineer on a certain aspect of our facility... I had purposefully stayed away from this lady because I had initially felt an attraction to her. But, then we were assigned to work together for the remainder of the project. 7 days a week, 12 hours a day... We ended up having drinks and then three weeks and a weird little time/ reality warp for me later... I had had an affair. fake email accounts. dozens of emails chit chatting like school kids, organisation of nights spent cooking dinner or watching a movie.......stupid stupid shit...Then I go home. Things were different. My wife's temper tantrums seem childish and petty, she pouted over everything. She acted like things were horrible. I had very little patience for her..I felt sharp and ready to be able to do something other than chase each other around in a constant state of one emotionally ""not right"" and the other bending over backwards to comfort the first. But after a few days, I start to warm to her again and remember why I put up with that shit.. what it was I DID like about her. It just took a while.... She got on my laptop to ""pay bills"" and if you brought up gmail it automatically brought up the fake account...with dozens of lovey dovey emails... She then emailed them all to her mom, for posterity. She proclaimed me one more chance, but I had to end it with my mistress and quit my job that had just started to make enough to catch our debt all up and pay off some things.. She and the three therapists we went to said I was a sex addict and that I wasn't seeing the truth of things. I couldn't....wouldn't believe I was that far off... me and the mistress had something... surely. I ""broke up"" with her, but wouldn't quit my job because I was supposed to go back to Singapore, immediately board the vessel and sail it around to Angola..so I wouldn't be in Singapore to see the mistress, who was in Australia visiting family anyway. The wife agreed to these terms. Well, mistress came back early and met me in the airport. It was all ""lovey dovey"" again.. except it wasn't....not for me. I couldn't understand what we had talked about. I had nothing in common with this woman and she was no where near as attractive as my wife. The vessel had been delayed two days, so I of course spent the night with the mistress ""just to see"".. It was all different. Before, it was like porn.....amazing mind blowing.... now, it was forced and awkward and not good in any aspect. I couldn't believe how much I had lied to myself. How deluded I was.. I left and told mistress it was over, I wouldn't leave my wife, things weren't what I thought they were.. she kept in touch over the next couple weeks though... which my wife found of course.....and that was that. She left while I was offshore the coast of Africa. I told myself I'd get treatment for being so delusional....an addict... I'd get treatment and she'd come back and we could live happily ever after. After of course she went and played and ""got back"" at me... it's what people do... I agreed to give her 50% of my retirement, 40% gross of my check (at the time which is far inflated from what I normally make) for four years, and the car. I get both money pits of real estate ""investments"". Since we were only married 7 yrs and we were in Cali, she probably wouldn't have gotten all that if I made her go to court... as it was, she was a year away from a phd, which I had taken on immense debt for her to pursue. But, I did it with the hope that it would buy me some time to get rehab and prove I was able to ""walk the line""...._PERSON_ come back after she ""sowed her oats"" or whatever, right? I was sure of it.. so, I gave her everything possible and attempted being as supportive as possible for her to stand on her own.. it was her first time ever not living in someone else's place after all...and in a big city.... So, I've been there.We've been separated since May 2012 and divorced just about a year....I'm not even sure when the papers were filed.. I can't stand to look at them. I've made progress in bettering myself....but not spectacular or amazing progress... I ended up drinking and smoking weed again... alot in fact that first year. It's pretty much a blur of smoking, drinking, and crying...  Now I see that my life hasn't been designed by me at all. There has been very little of my life that I would have chosen to put there, that's part of the reason I want to numb myself, to escape.... I've not advocated, worked, and pursued any goal for no other reason than I like it.... I didn't pursue any happiness other than in her.. which wasn't enough for me to be completely happy. She's blocked me on Facebook, both my original account and my new account where I've started hanging out with hippies and meditation wierdos and that sort of stuff...So, I started another... and after a little snooping, I see that she's been seeing this guy for most of this year at least. People were commenting on a ridiculously good picture of the two of them and asking if it was their engagement pic and his aunt was saying how good it was he had found his beautiful bride. She was beautiful too. She's cleaned up alot, grew out her hair, lost a little weight, colored and straightened hair, bla bla.... I got none of that.. I got dingy and tattered clothes, disheveled hair that was being let to get as curly, etc... the list goes on..  He's a USMC pilot, an avid Christian, a surfer, believes in a ""truth"", and is appears to be a successful, well adjusted, friendly, in shape, and all around good kinda guy. Nothing like me. I'm pretty close to exactly opposite of those things, with the exception of I make probably three or four times as much money as he does. I'm able to blend well enough and make small talk, but I'm never quite one of the guys... I think if you look long enough with enough skill, you'll see that ""truth"" tends to fall apart...as does everything in this reality and I'm certainly not a follower of any Abrahamic cult. So, point being, I'm freaked out... really freaked out. It's the divorce but for real this time. She's really gone. She isn't planning on negotiating or watching me prove my love to her... or turn my life around or none of that shit. She's gone and moved on. It hurts just as bad as it did when she originally left. I'm emotionally volatile just like I was right after she left, flashes of rage and fire through my skin, followed by hopelessness and cold tears push through... I've been better at keeping them from disrupting my day this time though. I've almost been able to bluff my coworkers that nothing is different....because it really isn't. It's just my perception of it that is. My therapist doesn't work Fridays and won't respond until Monday morning probably, I've asked for a Skype session asap... but until then, I figured I'd post here. I know you're all gonna jump aboard and tell me to suck it up and it's what I get. I know. I've come to a much more harsh realzation of how time only goes forward and a mistake at any point along the line, will not be able to be undone later on. What's done is done. She won't ever trust me again. She think's I'm a pervert and a liar. I guess I am. I don't know how ugly people will be, but I feel like there won't be much pity.... and I guess that's appropriate, but it felt nice talking to myself about it all while typing it... Now, I have to get back to designing and creating a life that is as weird as I want it to be....one that, even though I'm 39 now and losing my hair and probably will never have love like that again, nor have children... one that I can smile just because it's a fun life....to me."
2dmax8,37948,Dance,1408091710,"How much value can I expect from a trip to Argentina for dance lessons, when starting at pretty much zero?","So, I was recently in Peru and while out at a night club, I ended up dancing with some local ladies. They attempted to teach me to Latin dance with them (no idea what the name would have been), right foot forward, back to center, left foot back, back to center, lots of hip shaking, a few turns thrown in), which I thoroughly enjoyed and for the few moments of flow that I achieved (even if the movement wasn't great), it was incredible. I very quickly realized the playfulness, fun, and sensual intimacy that this method of communication could lead to. In fact, I’m a little disappointed that my family didn't think that as a young man, I should know how to dance. Anyhow, I work offshore on an oil platform, 28 days offshore followed by 28 days off of work. So, I can travel pretty much anywhere for my time off and I can stay there for an extended period of time. It occurred to me that I should go to Argentina and learn to tango. I could go there for my 28 days and take two or even three lessons a day for ~25 days, excluding travel days. Surely I could improve my skill set in this period of time. Not saying I would have mastered anything, but that I would have a rudimentary understanding of the basic skill set and steps. I could of course continue this education later in wherever I found myself, but this would be like a dance boot camp. My questions: Would this be a worthwhile exercise? I have no dance training and music isn't really my strength. Is Tango an appropriate dance to teach timing, movement, working in an intimate pair, etc???Is Argentina a good country to go to for a learning vacation such as this? Or is there a lesser known location that would be able to teach me similar concepts for a cheaper price, a quick search on the internet and it appears that Argentina has a pretty large industry for this type of vacation. It’s very possible that another country would be able to teach me as much and be less tourist industry oriented.Thanks for any advice you might have… I hope to see some of you on a dance floor one day!"
2ezztt,37948,SuicideWatch,1409399954,"Divorce was my fault....I should pay for breaking the ""contract"".","I cheated, twice, once before I got caught and then I went back for one last night and to ""see if it was really not a 'real' relationship (with the mistress)""....and had very a long history of disturbing porn. This was to much and she's left me. I have held on to the idea that I could work on myself and she could herself and in 1.5 yrs (from now, 4 total) of paying spousal support, we'd both be independent and able to start dating each other again.. It didn't occur to me that there was an option of not reconciling. Dating other people during our ""break"" would be a growing thing... I would still be here for her if she needed anything or if someone hurt her or threatened to hurt her. I just found out she's getting re-married in January. I tried to tell myself I could stop it. I tried to believe I could do some grandiose act and change her mind. She's marrying him because he's solid, stable,....boring. Not emotionally reactive like me. Not with all this dark, perverse baggage, like me. She's not marrying him because she loves him. But, I've had to come to that realization. I made her say it last night. I said mean things until she quit trying to ""not hurt my feelings""..... I made her tell me how much anger and resentment comes up towards me when she thinks of me. I made her tell me how she can't see ever getting over us...me..not in this lifetime.. That she doesn't even want to. She wants to hang on to that hurt, to use it remind her of what can happen. She's not even trying to find forgiveness for me. I made her tell me she loves him.I feel that I had a contract to provide for and protect her. Yes, I broke one of the stipulations of that contract. But in some weird twisted vision I had, the highest concern was to provide for and protect her. I provided for her extremely well....well, for my education I did I suppose. My job took me away alot....but she drove a luxury sedan and lived in some of the nicer areas of the cities we lived in. She was safe and provided for. Like my contract stated. Now, there is no contract. Or so it would seem. She's released me from that contract with her. But, my heart doesn't feel that way. It feels like there was a blood oath that I must pay for. I promised her my life. I promised to give my life for her, to her. I promised something bigger than her, something bigger than me. I don't know if I'd call it ""god"", but certainly to the underlying consciousness of the universe. The consciousness that sees all, that knows all, that is all. I made a promise of my life to THAT. I feel like I should find her in person, walk up to her, and tell the Universe that ""The contract is paid""....and pull the trigger on a revolver with one bullet in some random chamber (Russian Roulette). At very least I should shoot my ring finger off. Or give the Universe the opportunity to do so.  I don't know how else to get this nagging feeling of owing blood to go away. tldr... I want to play Russian Roulette in order to pay a cosmic debt in order to move on from my broken marriage...or not."

2rm58k,37948,steroids,1420623603,Pellets or nothing? Due to work circumstances,"I work overseas on a 28 day rotational cycle. So, every 28 days I'm flying across the planet either to or from work. Carrying needles/ injectables through the airport is not preferable, unless I can get a script. So, I went to a TRT clinic and had a blood test. My result was 471. They offered to give me the pellet ""procedure"" and estimated that I would be give either 5 or maybe 6 pellets. They flat out will not prescribe injectables, but will ""compromise"" and discuss the gel (though with the caveat that they recommend against it). Of course, they went on about the pellet hormone being ""bioidentical"" and seen by the body as completely natural and that this (somehow) means that there will be fewer side effects in comparison to injectables. Since I (a) don't have a source for injectables yet (either way, script or not) and (b) travel through the airport so often, would it be advantageous to get the pellets in the meantime and then IF I can find injectables, just lower the dosage due to the pellets already working? But, at least I would I have a slight step up from where I'm at right now? They want $1800 for a 12 month supply of pellets, which is about 2 cycles of implants. I don't know if this includes the necessary blood tests in the mean time. Not sure if I can expect enough of a bump to make it worth while. Is five or six pellets actually enough to see physical results? Thanks everyone.."

He has a real office that looks official and medical and is respected by a lot of business people.  He gave my dad some Chinese medicine.  The medicine caused a HUGE reaction on my dad's skin.  My dad, being all proud and brainwashed, decided it was just ""burning out the impurities"" or some bullshit.  He had all these nasty boils on his leg.  He keeps quiet about this.  A few days later, in the middle of him trying to fly to the US to visit - an 18 hr+ flight - his leg gets so bad that he is in horrible agony.  When my mom picks him up at the airport, they have to go straight to the ER. He gets slapped with an $8000 hospital bill because his traveler's insurance refuses to cover.After ALL OF THIS, he still believes in the stupid Chinese medicine.

As soon as the weather starts to warm up, she gets flare ups.  It is worst in the hottest parts of summer, and terrible when she is out in the heat.  She loves soccer and I've signed her up for soccer camp and other summer camps.  I just don't know what to do.  I don't want to keep her from things, but the heat makes her eczema so terrible.  We've tried many steroid creams with varying success.  The last one we have been trying worked for a few flare ups, and now has completely lost all efficacy.  She hates lotion and will scream and cry if I put it on her because it stings.  Any ideas?  I've got an appt with the derm, but I couldn't get in until the end of June!  What the fuck is with these people? The office promised to call me back today but they never get around to it.  I hate dermatologists with a fiery passion.  I had acne problems when I was younger and they were complete dicks about it and multiple derms tried to get me to go on accutane for my mild acne.  Prescribed me antibiotics that didn't do shit but fuck up my stomach.  I don't know if I can trust the dermatologist at all.  I hate them and I hate putting my daughter through all this crap that doesn't work.  I feel so bad for her.  I just want her to be able to live her life without being itchy and bumpy everywhere.

[my previous thread](_URL_ much harping and calling repeatedly being ignored for a few days, we finally got into see the derm.  I don't think he handles the calls, but the office harpies are pretty awful about letting me speak to him.  Once I got to talk to him, it was much more reassuring as the derm has a kid with eczema.  The derm prescribed Triamcinolone (steroid cream).  After 3 nights of use it seemed to clear up almost completely.  Although her eczema is heat triggered and the temperatures dipped these three days coincidentally.  Still trying to get to the bottom of it and seeing an allergist.Then I noticed something different.  She had these pus filled zits.  About three on her leg and two on her back.  Not exactly a terrible break out, but I googled pictures and believe it to be a staph infection.  I read that there are known associations where staph will get into breaks of the skin due to eczema, so it seems likely.The derm prescribed liquid amoxicillin.  Now I am also reading about how important the gut bacteria might be to eczema, and I don't really want to put her on the oral antibiotic unless it's really necessary.  Half the internet is really intense about how staph will get into your blood and you will die and half is like, ""it will clear up on its own.""  So what I did was clean her pimple spots with _PERSON_ and dabbed a bit of rubbing alcohol.  Just on and around the small spots because I didn't want to dry up her skin.  I put 2 small bandaids on them because I just KNOW she will scratch at it and it will burst everywhere and that would be worse.  I've only noticed this for the past day and a half.Does anyone else have any experience with staph infections and eczema?  Did it clear up on its own or did you have to go on topical or oral antibiotics?  In my opinion I feel like these 5 zits are not enough to warrant oral antibiotics, but please offer some insight.  **update!**  This is the fourth day since I have noticed the pus pimples.  I've been religiously washing her spots with _PERSON_ and dabbing with rubbing alcohol and then covering up with _PERSON_ (petroleum jelly) after.  So far the pimples have popped but they have not spread.  I consider that a success.  I hope the bacteria are not the voracious MRSA kind; it doesn't seem to be."

Then came out the anger issues that I've finally noticed as serious. I had to just scream into a pillow and I went through some convulsions that always happen when I can't contain it anymore. I figured going to sleep would help, but I just walked into my bathroom, grabbed some scissors, and started to cut. I got angry again and just kept going over and over again.

I really have nothing to be overly upset about except for some disappointing relationships and rejections. I lost all of my close friends except for one over the past couple years. I'm doing well in school, but not up to the standards my parents have and possibly not good enough to get into the one school I actually want to go to. Last year I just got overwhelmed by everything and basically stopped working towards anything in school and I've become a lazy and anxious mess. I want to go out and do something, but I'll just become anxious that I won't enjoy it or the people around me won't enjoy my company. Also, I just relapsed and started cutting for the first time in three years.

He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty. ""Now, who still wants it?""Still the hands went into the air.***""My friends, you have all learned a very valuable lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20. Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless; but no matter what happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value. _PERSON_ or clean, crumpled or finely creased, you are still priceless to those who love you.

2g9tam,15232,selfharm,1410591731,My personal war (Some parts may be triggering),"I finally escaped an awful summer and I enjoyed the first two weeks of school like never before, but I turned each little stressor from school into a big deal.I told myself that I wouldn't have to come back here again after the first time I stopped. That lasted a couple weeks and then the next one for about a month until a few nights ago. I guess the addiction has set in heavily as day in and day out I lose focus on everything around me and I can picture myself taking my scissors and cutting. I almost feel and hear the rip of my skin as I sit in class or at home. These urges can only be controlled for so long as I found out three days ago.Even as I feel the regret of my actions I can feel my blood boil, yearning to escape. I belittle myself, ""You're not good enough for that."" ""They don't really care."" ""Why would they want you around?"" Slowly pushing myself to a point where I nearly break down and cave in.The positives around me are always accompanied by multiple negatives that are major overreactions, but that doesn't stop me from focusing on just the negatives. The escape from the horrors of summer is spectacular, but the stress of school, pressure to get into that college of my dreams, judgements by others that likely only exist in my mind, and the constant reminder to keep my arms out of sight weigh nearly as heavily as that feeling of being this pathetic outcast during the summer.Not only that, but now that I've made some great friends on Reddit and I still have my one good friend, I keep pushing them away, avoiding too much conversation, getting annoyed at every little thing. People try to talk to me and reassure me that things will improve and be okay, but they've been in my position and they know better than that. Things will change for sure, but the certainty of improvement is far from plausible to me. I know they want to help, but it's just as good as spewing absolute bullshit most of the time.This mindset, this gut wrenching urge, these actions, they all tear me apart and I can only escape through the keys on my keyboard or the eventual release. The release that I ***know*** will tear me apart even more. I'm lost in my own dilemma of which pain to feel, and I can't free myself from this battle within.I don't know what choice I have but to endure this until I can finally get to see this new psychiatrist and possibly find a way out of this. Even so I cant help but wonder if this man will let me down or if these medications will only act as a fuel to the inferno raging inside.I must endure. For it is my last chance at survival."

But I'm no longer just afraid, I'm terrified; I'm terrified of more than just that.I'm terrified that I really am slipping away from my one close friend and the girl who has always been there for me that I can't help but be crazy about. I'm terrified my new deep cuts will open in class, that all eyes will be on me. Terrified that it'll lead me back to where I was at when I had to go into inpatient care. I feel like I'm already slipping to that state only a month later. Now that I bought new, sharper razors I've cut nearly to fat and even though it nearly caused me to pass out I'm terrified because part of me wants to go back.I'm terrified that I'll have no control, that the other side of me that comes out when I cut will take over and lead me to the edge and right over it. It already causes me to paint my own fucking blood on my face like a sadistic war paint and paint words in the sink with the rest.

First step from here is at the very least to make it to the new year clean.I just hope you all know that a relapse is indeed part of recovery, it doesn't mean you failed yourself or anyone around you, so try to keep your head up and push forward! :)I hope you're all doing well and staying safe tonight &lt;3"

All the problems with depression, self-harm, and countless other issues are alarmingly common and it seems like everyone just turns away and puts those people in some sort of ""insane"" or ""attention-seeking"" category.Stop being an ignorant prick and open your eyes. There are people constantly suffering from these horrific diseases.My main problem is with the view on self-harm and suicidal ideation.People see that someone has done anything to harm themselves (cutting, burning, breaking, etc.) and instantly think they're some attention seeker. Honestly, if it comes to the point of fucking over your body for ***whatever*** reason it should be treated as a medical emergency and something to be looked at immediately! It is a massive problem and warning sign of much deeper problems, not just something easily classified as someone looking for attention or whatever cop-out reason people think it's for.Also, with the ever so popular idea that suicide/suicidal ideation is a ""selfish"" or ""weak"" concept is just fucking ignorant. Someone's problems become so horrendous that they would prefer to never exist over any other option, and your first thought is that their just some selfish and weak person? Get your head out of your ass and look at what is going on. This is an extremely serious situation that requires immediate attention and care, not something to be taken lightly or looked upon with disgust.I really do hope that some sort of change happens soon with these issues before they become even more common than they already are. After dealing with depression, self-harm, and suicidal ideation I realized how horribly ignorant the world is towards this issue and it is just disgusting."

I was finally able to hang out with some people for the first time in months and one of my friends was treating depression and self harm as a joke which kinda snapped me out of my month and a half of feeling great. Since then I've been yelled at every few hours for being lazy, careless, stupid, and other words I've shut out by my mom since I'm not doing anything at home (even though I'm getting all my work done in school.) I'm starting to feel my impulsive anger return as well as minor visions of death, so my minor period of dissociation may be returning, and these urges have been harder to push away because of all of it added up. On top of all of that I still have my decision notification date for the college I've been wanting to go to coming up on the 15th so I'm having even more anxiety, and to top it all off my mom is also implying she doubts I'll get in by telling me to look into my other choices more.

qr0lv,17153,SuicideWatch,1331432002,Relapse,"22yofI've had trouble with suicidal thoughts before. Depression has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I grew up in a toxic environment with an abusive father and a mother who protected him. I moved out when I went to college. I was raped by my bf of 6 years; it pushed me over the edge and sent me to the psych ward. I got help, received counseling, and started medication. My depression wasn't so bad, and the incessant thoughts about ending my life finally stopped for the first time in years (literally, I thought about it EVERY DAY for YEARS). I moved back home because the place I was living increased their rent and I could not find work to help pay for the difference. I cleaned out the dump that was the basement and turned it into an ""apartment"" with curtain walls. Things were OK I guess, for a little while. My dad had gotten less violent, and I was rarely home. It's now been 2 semesters (almost a year). My depression has been coming back. At first, it was the general ""don't want to get out of bed in the morning"" feeling. Then it sucked the joy and fun from everything I cared about. Two days ago, the thoughts came back. I haven't even considered killing myself for the past year and a half, and now I can't get the thoughts out of my head. It's like a broken record in my brain playing over and over and over and over. TL;DR: Have depression. Took meds and got therapy to get rid of suicidal thoughts. They came back when I moved back home. Ranting about life"
r6c81,17153,SuicideWatch,1332306109,Too Many Questions,"I just got back from missing a month of school. I used to skip class all the time, but I turned my act around this semester. Then I got sick. Week after that, I had a death in the family. The next week was gone by running a Goodwill clothing drive that caused me to miss 2 exams. I asked my profs if I could take a make-up. One said no, and said I contacted her too late. I was OK with that. The other said yes, and asked me tons of questions afterwards. Like why didn't you tell me about this earlier? Why didn't you turn in a random assignment from 3 weeks ago? The judgmental look in her eye is just too much right now. I would understand the questions if they came BEFORE she decided to let me make up the test, but she's asking these AFTER. There's no way to explain everything to her. I don't know what to do. It's my 2 year anniversary with my bf tomorrow, but all I can think about is having to take a test for an hour with her drilling me with questions about why I do/don't do different things. I'm FINALLY able to walk around campus on most days and not have flashbacks. For the longest time, I'd have a flashback to my ex raping me every time I saw a guy that looked like him. I finally broke up with him; I left an abusive relationship. Not only that, I stayed in school and managed to continue passing classes despite moderate-severe depression. Then, I turned my attendance around. And because of extenuating circumstances I couldn't go to class for a few weeks in a row. I was too nervous and anxious to ask for help, and it took every ounce of courage to ask for a make-up. Now, despite all I've overcome, I have to endure more questions about why I missed a petty assignment a few weeks ago or was absent to a couple classes. I feel I've overcome enough in my life. I know I'll at least stick around until after my anniversary with my bf. That's all I have to hold on to right now."
sbec4,17153,relationships,1334528892,Is it wrong to be mad at this?,"22yof dating a 22yom for 2 yearsHere's the story from the beginning: My bf, let's call him _PERSON_, got drunk with me and some friends one night and told me he had a crush on one of our mutual friends (let's call her Pear) while we were dating. He also went on a rather long tirade about what could possibly be wrong with the relationship that would cause him to feel that way (most were things we were currently working on like bedroom problems because I was raped). He also said he was questioning our relationship as a result of this crush. This caused a lot of jealousy on my part, which I've been able to deal with pretty well.Fast forward to a few months ago. My bf and I had a few drunken conversations with some friends about possibly trying weed, and that we would do it for the first time together. Then, _PERSON_ was going on a weekend trip with some of his guy friends. Before he left, he told me they were going to be eating pot brownies. I was mildly disappointed that our first time getting high wouldn't be together but I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. He went on the weekend trip, came back, and things went on as usual. However, despite me asking how it went, he didn't really tell me anything about the experience for almost a week. I was rather annoyed at this and let him know. Things continued on as usual, no biggie.This weekend, I found out from Pear (group trip, talking in hotel room) that _PERSON_ was texting her when he was high. The fact that he had barely told me anything and then was texting a girl he had liked/questioned our relationship over instead infuriated me. I didn't want to make a scene and I prefer to cool down before discussing something I'm upset over so I am waiting until tonight to talk to him about it. What is your perspective on this issue? Is it unreasonable for me to be upset about _PERSON_: Bf got high for the first time with some of his friends without me. We were going to do that together. He told me nothing about that night for about a week. I found out he was texting our mutual female friend (questioned our relationship b/c of crush on her) while he was high. I'm pissed. Is that wrong? If so, explain your thought process."
tw9wc,17153,relationships,1337539265,PTSD and a Passive Aggressive Father,"22yof with obvious daddy-issues. My father has always been a very angry man. He was physically abusive to me and my siblings up until we were 18. He has always been verbally and emotionally abusive to everyone in our household. I still live at home (not very happily) while going to school due to financial reasons. **_PERSON_ was raped 3 years ago by my then bf. It was a very toxic relationship that took me over a year to get out of once the assault took place. I have  moderate PTSD as a result of the trauma I endured (flashbacks, avoiding situations, outbursts, jumpiness, etc). My dad knows about everything because I confided in my mother and she told him for me (with my permission).**What Happened**Yesterday at a birthday party, my dad, mom, godparents, sister, and friend were sitting around the fire talking about TV shows, gossip, etc. He brought up how in the past week, someone who we know was arrested for rape because his daughter came forward, reported him, and wore a wire for the cops while her dad assaulted her (good for her). However, instead of leaving it there, my dad decided to say ""*she* wasn't going to let it control her life,"" and ended the topic there. I had to endure very awkward, ""did he really say what I think he said?"" stares from everyone there because they all knew what had happened to me, and my ex used to be a part of that social group. I've had a LOT of trouble dealing with what happened to me, and it causes me a lot of pain to have it thrown in my face by someone who is supposed to support me. I'm not sure how to react to this. I don't think talking to him is an option, and my mother will think that ""he didn't mean it like that."" TL;DR: I have PTSD becasue I was raped, and my family knows.

This has been causing me a lot of grief and worry about what will happen if his behavior continues to go unchecked. **Reason to Report:**I am very afraid that other women will be hurt if I don't report. I just want there to be something on the record in case he does something in the future. It is still within the 20 year statute of limitations in my state (Ohio, USA). **Reason to NOT Report:**I am terrified of what he would do in retaliation if he ever found out that I reported him. I am also afraid that I will not be taken seriously by the police because the city I was raped in has a lot of crime and a notoriously lazy police system.  I also know that if it went to trial, he would get off no problem because there is no evidence. Reddit, do you think I should report for the potential good of others?

I have had so many diagnoses that I don't think I'll ever really know what the fuck is wrong with me.  At 10 I tried to kill myself, not fully understanding what that meant, and I was diagnosed, ""severe emotional disturbance.""  How encouraging for a small, sad child.  A few years later it was ADD, then it was anxiety/depression.  My last suicide attempt (of very few) was in 2010.  I was 20 years old.  I didn't know the first thing about guns and thought that if I pulled the trigger it would just happen, but I was caught in the act.I have been taking Paxil 30mg once a day for about a year, after having been on countless other drugs that essentially only damaged my psyche further.  Adderall, Wellbutrin, Celexa, Lexapro, Depakote, Abilify, Concerta and the list goes on.  Every single one of these medications made me feel worse in one way or another.  For the first time, I'm on something that has stabilized me just enough so that I have the confidence and energy to work on myself properly.Well, right now my life is changing.  My dad is a heroin addict with a lot of psychological issues, and my relationship with him has always been unpleasant.  My parents split up when I was just 3 years old.  My dad comes in and out of my life.  When he was in it, he'd be physically and verbally abusive.  So I can't count him out of my support program.  My mom always took care of us well enough, but she was constantly searching for love and often times I'd take a backseat to her boyfriends.  More recently, she left my _PERSON_] and I in November to move across the country to live with a guy she just met, and left me to take care of both of us.  I had 2 weeks notice.  She's back home temporarily to get ready to move us out of this apartment.  My sister is going with her, and I have to find a place to live on my own.I don't want to live in this area anymore because it's too expensive, so I'm moving somewhere I'm not going to know a single soul.  I've always felt as though I was completely alone.  The people who are supposed to be me supporters are only really worried about themselves.  Now I'm truly going to be alone in a far away place.Last, I ran out of my medication last week.  I couldn't get ahold of my doctor, and I had no refills left.  Today I managed to get in contact with an emergency on-call psychiatrist, but no pharmacies in the area will be open until Monday at the *very* earliest.Things are stressful enough for me right now without having to worry about my meds.  Now I don't have them and the withdrawal symptoms are really getting to me.  I know if I had them, they wouldn't kick in immediately, but I'd at least have some peace of mind knowing they were there."

SPOILERS.  _PERSON_'s main plot ends with the _PERSON_ defeating _PERSON_ in *Sovngarde.*  The _PERSON_, a *human* has defeated an immortal dragon, which many people believed was possible.  An old _PERSON_ legend, and something foretold in the scrolls themselves.Next - *The scrolls tell everything from the beginning of time, to the end of time.*  Many times in the Elder Scrolls universe, especially _PERSON_, you will hear that the return of _PERSON_ is the ""endtimes.""  The battle between _PERSON_ and the _PERSON_ is the last event to ever take place on the timeline recorded in the Elder Scrolls (the actual scrolls, not the game titles).My theory is that this was a test given by Akatosh to determine the future of the world.  The result?  That's the interesting part.As far as we know, the world of The Elder Scrolls universe is largely governed by the gods.  The Elder Scrolls predict every event in history.  Everything is predetermined.  Well, what not?  We've reached the end of the timeline give to us by the scrolls!  I theorize that it's the end of the age of the gods, and the dawn of the age of man.The future of the world is now in the hands of the people themselves, rather than the Aedra and _PERSON_ having the majority of the control.  The people have proven, when the _PERSON_ battled _PERSON_, that they have the power, the strength, the resolve and *the will* to ensure the continuation of their existence.  They people want to live.  The want their world.This is my theory.  It may seem a bit vague, but it's what I think.Side note:  One of the response options when Paarthurnax asks the _PERSON_ why he wants to save the world is, ""I like this world.  I don't want it to end."" I think that speaks volumes for the men and mer of Nirn."
1flhil,46849,thisdreamihad,1370284568,I had a very strange dream about love.,"I had a dream that some fictional 40 year old friend of mine and I met a two women; a mother and daughter whose ages matched ours.  We met at a mall, and we all hit it off really well.  I could literally feel myself falling for this girl.  The rapport was almost as beautiful as she was.  The chemistry was so... real.  I was falling in love.  It was so strange.  I felt like I had literally just met my soul mate.  It was instantaneous.  I thought about my friend who is actually supposed to come hang out today, and that shook me out of the dream.When I awoke, I realized it was super early and I'd had only about four hours of sleep.  So I went back to sleep.The dream continued!  Some time had passed.  Maybe several months, or maybe a year, but I was at that mall again with her and a bunch of her friends.  Instead of thinking I was in a dream, I had realized that I didn't have any memory of the time that had passed, so I told her there was something really important I wanted to tell her. (in my mind, it was that I had some weird sort of blackouts that made me lose huge chunks of time).So when we stepped aside to talk about it, I asked her if she remembered the day we met.  She explained it to me in more detail than the dream itself had even had.  She started to get lost in her own story as if she was remembering meeting... her soul mate.  Then I asked her if she was in love with me.  She scoffed and looked around nervously, and then said, ""yeah I mean, pfft, since like two weeks ago.""  It seemed to me like she wasn't quite ready to admit she loved me, but I had put her on the spot.So we're still at that mall, and we sit down to eat, and we joke around and I end up chasing her around the mall all cute and romcom like.  Then I suddenly was a child, in a house.  I had super powers, and I knew it, but I didn't know how to tell anyone.  It was just me and my fictional father, and I longed for the girl I had met.  After that, the dream sort of became another, less important dream about a boy with super powers.One interesting symbol in this dream was the jacket I was wearing.  It was a black, maybe dark, deep green with orange on the inside.  I was wearing it when I met her, and then in part two, I put the jacket on again.I never got to tell her about my blackouts, or the time gap.  I just couldn't.  She had more time to fall in love with me, because she didn't lose any memory, but I didn't need that much time.  Meeting her once was enough.  We were supposed to go to prom together.  I'm at a total loss.  This dream was so real, and I was about a step away from it being lucid.  There were a lot of reminders of the real world, and that I was dreaming, but I just never quite caught on.Something to giggle at here, _PERSON_ played my love interest.  Yeah.  I know.Thanks for reading!  I'm sort of disappointed to be awake.EDIT - Now that I think about it, love can make you feel like a child, and it can also make you feel like _PERSON_.

His face has changed a bit, and from my point of view he looks quite a bit younger.**The Theory**Now, when Cole absorbs energy, he is healed.  Presumably because of his supernatural tie to electricity, he can absorb it to heal his wounds.  Using this information, it is my belief that Cole is getting younger because of his powers.  Every time he absorbs energy, he is healed, thus slowly reversing the aging process.  The best example I can give you is to just *look* at him.  Listen to his voice.  He originally looked as though he might be in his mid 30s.  Now he looks like he's maybe... 25?  His voice has changed.  It's not as deep and rough anymore, so his vocal cords have healed from what was probably too much stress (or nodules or something).So it stands to reason that his powers are essentially granting him a small form of immortality.

1qbf95,46849,rant,1384106277,This was written by a 23 year old male.,"After reading this _URL_ I became enraged.  So I wrote a response to it.Prepare yourselves for a wall of text, because I'm pissed.Eh. I'd say about 50% of what she said is sort of sensible. All that, ""then get a job"" shit makes it sound more cut and dry than it really is. My single mother and her two kids were on welfare and food stamps up until I was maybe 12. You know what? She had a goddamn job. She busted her ass for 10 hours a day working for rich people who treated her like shit. And you know what? She still didn't make enough to provide for her two kids when there was no father in the picture. Do you think that our family, complete with a 7 year old girl should be put into the aforementioned government housing? Do you think that would be beneficial for the well being of small children? Or would you rather have them taken and moved into a home with someone else? Away from their mother? Away from the person who has done everything in her power to support us? The person who did no drugs, paid her car insurance, paid the bills, worked every day of the week, didn't drink, didn't smoke cigarettes, cleaned up after her two kids, and put up with racist neighbors in podunk white suburbia? Most years we got one or two Christmas presents each. Whenever I hear the whole, ""get a job"" thing in regards to welfare, it really hits home for me. There's already a massive stigma around welfare without going to this extreme. What about medicaid? If my mom could barely afford to keep a roof over our heads, she surely couldn't afford to pay for medical bills, right? There were a lot of those. I was a troubled child. I was in therapy a lot, took prescription medication, and gave my mom a horrible time at home. So she should be expected to pay for that too when she can't afford it, or should I have just suffered? The problem is, people see you whip out that green access card and are quick to judge. They think to themselves, ""get a job."" or ""lazy"" orsomething about getting a free ride from the government. Do you really think it's that glorious? Everything is paid for for me! I haven't a care in the world! Wrong. Did you think about asking that person about their situation? How do you know they don't have a job? Did you ask? Did they volunteer that information to you? Some people have jobs that just aren't enough. So what's your argument? Get a better job? Well clearly this person (like my mother) is more than willing to work, so don't you think they'd have a better job of the opportunity was available? Yes. They would. We should not be persecuting the people who are troubled. We should be focused more on helping them to overcome the boundaries and obstacles they're facing. Not punishing them with something that sounds dangerously similar to prison, or dare I say, a concentration camp. These people need help. Many of them have undiagnosed mental illnesses, and need to be HELPED. Not fucking thrown into a pit where their already miserable lives become that much more miserable. All these people who are anti-welfare and anti-medicaid... have they ever had a conversation with someone who was in one of these situations? Either way, you need to talk to someone who has been in my shoes. In my mother's shoes. In my sister's shoes. We needed help. Do you know what happened? My mother got off welfare and food stamps. She didn't like the way people treated her because of it. She didn't like the stigma attached to it, and she didn't like feeling like someone was holding her hand. So things got even more difficult monetarily speaking. Which made her more stressed out. And as many of you may or may not know, children feel the stress of their parents. Especially single parents. All we had was each other. So that stress was felt by my sister and I. I was already in emotional turmoil as a kid, and boy that sure helped.  Listen, I could go on forever about this, but I'm going to cut myself off there. There are a lot of circumstances that most people don't know about because they've never had to experience them firsthand. I've had enough of the judgmental attitudes toward this sort of thing. There are of course those who abuse this system, as with ANY system. The real task here is to weed out those who are TRYING to get a free ride, not those who need a goddamn leg up. So the next time you see someone in front of you in line pulling out that access card, instead of thinking, ""fucking freeloader"" or ""get a job,"" try thinking instead, ""i wonder what this person's circumstances are."" or, ""I hope they're doing okay"" or even, if you have the balls for it, reach out. Offer your help. Do you work for a company that's hiring? Let them know privately about the opportunity. Reach out. Extend a helping hand to these people, not a clenched fist.That's the end of my rant.  I'm sure many of you will disagree with me, but until you've physically *lived* the life of poverty, you don't get to fucking tell us what's what.  Most of this is just racism anyway.On the topic of racism, I grew up white, with a hispanic mother, and a black sister.  Racial intolerance is already a huge problem in white suburbia.  People of color?  Get them out of here!  Oh no, they're going to ruin our nice town!  As if that's not bad enough, white people *hate* it when people of different colors mix.  A hispanish mother with a white son and a black daughter?  Disgusting.Fuck you. _PERSON_ you for kicking families like ours when they were down. _PERSON_ you  for your stigmas and comments and prejudices."

Title screen is way too fast, but gameplay is horrendously slow... almost a standstill.And on PCSX2- **Graffiti Kingdom** runs perfectly.

1rrr1j,46849,linguistics,1385814019,Would any of you folks be interested in a discussion about the ever-changing accent/dialect of Philadelphia and other mid-Atlantics?,"I'm certainly no linguist, by any means, but I have always been fascinated by all things related to sound.  This is why I pursued music composition (though I'm not famous, as my name implies).  I'm from Philadelphia originally, but of course, never considered myself to have an accent - which is normal.  However, I always thought that my ""accent"" was the same as the sort of broadcast version of the, ""Standard American.""I moved up to central PA, and then all the way down south to Alabama only to find out that people can tell right away that I'm from southeastern Pennsylvania (some assume south Jersey, but it's not far off).Some of the major differences that I've noticed are things like words that sound the same to some people, sound different to me.  Such as, ""cot,"" and ""caught.""  Those two words are pronounced differently for me, but the same for people on the west coast, or down south.  _PERSON_, merry, and marry are all different vowel sounds for me.What really fascinates me is that my entire family is Philadelphia-born, and the accent my grandfather has is very different from my own.  He says words like, image, damage and scrimmage like, ""immej, dammeej, scrimmeej"" and so forth.  I have seen the youtube video, ""Philly's accent is changing,"" but I was disappointed that they didn't show any concrete examples.What are the origins of the Philly accent?  Why is it that we're the only major city in the northeast that doesn't drop the ""R"" as British English does?Even if anyone has links to interesting articles about the Philadelphia accent, I'd love to read them.  I hope to spark a lively discussion about this, since Philadelphia's accent is often overlooked, since it's not featured in the media very often.  The only thing I can think of is _PERSON_, but he has the *old* Philly accent.  Words like, ""beautiful"" become, ""beauty-full.""  He says, ""yous guys,"" whereas now people just tend to say.. yiz.  What are yiz doin' fer lunch?  Didjeet dinner?  Whajave?If anyone is interested, I'll record a vocaroo of myself so you can hear my accent for a general idea of what it sounds like in day to day conversation._PERSON_ does not rhyme with _PERSON_."

But it's ridiculous for us to keep pushing our votes for Daft Punk as, ""best edm artist of the year.""Daft Punk didn't release any electronic dance music this year.  Yes, it was dance music, but it's certainly not electronic.  The whole *point* of this album was to *not* be electronic.  It's not fair for us to keep pushing Daft Punk down everyone's throats when there might be an EDM artist who actually deserves awards of that nature.When _PERSON_ won and Daft Punk didn't, I was happy.  I really don't think _PERSON_ and Guy-Man want awards for electronic music in regards to RAM.  That's almost insulting.  Their intention was to do just the opposite.This is just my opinion, but seriously.  It'd be like giving _PERSON_ ""best rock and roll single of the year.""

I'm the elder brother to four girls (half sisters) of several different mixed races.  With ages ranging from 4 to 19 with no father present.  I started paying attention to feminism when I realized that my little sisters were, in fact, girls and that it was important to me that they were happy, and healthy (mentally and physically.)For years, any kind of rape scene or violence against a woman or even verbal abuse on television or in movies would make my heart sink to the floor.  Then it dawned on me.  **Men are villains.**I am a villain.  I grew to hate my own gender for the horrible atrocities they commit against women both behind closed doors and in broad daylight.  In a world of two genders, mine was the evil one.  How could I protect my loved ones from myself?  All men are potential rapists and child molesters.  Could I be capable of this too?  Surely I was different right?  No... I'm not different.  I'm a piece of human garbage, just like every other man.  I longed to prove the world wrong about men.  I wanted my sisters to be safe and happy, and to not have to fear men.  Was it possible?  My hatred for myself grew.Then I discovered the Men's Rights Movement.  It was somewhat uplifting to see that there was a movement of people who were trying to show the world that men are not villains!  It felt so good to see people giving a shit about *my* rights and civil liberties.  What about men who were wrongly accused?  Wrongly persecuted?  Wrongly convicted?  Yeah!  **Women are the true villains!**  I need to take precautionary measures to make sure my sisters don't become part of the womynz villainy!After some time I grew to realize that this, too, was utter nonsense.  Women are not heroes or villains.  Men are not heroes or villains.  *People* are heroes and villains.  Human beings.  I have ultimately discovered that both **modern** Feminism and Men's Rights are nonsense.  They both seem to focus the majority of their efforts on bringing the other down!  They both expect unrealistic things of the world.  World, lift us up and put us on the highest of pedestals!No.  I'm sorry, but no.  From this day forward, I wash my hands of both of these groups and will instead focus on being a good *person* rather than a good man, and I will help my sisters to be good *people* rather than good women.  The world is a difficult place, and nobody does it 100% right.  Equality is somewhat subjective, as it seems like there are an equal amount of issues on both sides that need to be addressed.  I'll let my sisters and I sort for ourselves what needs to be addressed and what doesn't.I love those girls, and I'm excited to be there when they become women.  At 23 years old, I fear I still have a lot of learning before I'll become a man.  Here's hoping that we all end up good people.Edit - I immediately regret posting this for fear of all of the anger I'm going to arouse.  _PERSON_ guys.  I just had to get this... off my chest."

The gold refers to the riches and ""gold"" of the wealthy victim.**Green.**Green is the colour of envy.  The protagonist envies this rich man for all that he has.  All of his wealth, and success.  People love him and flock to him because of his assets.The next part of the song goes like this - **Didn't hear your wicked words every day**My conscience/karma has never bothered me like this before.**And you used to be so sweet I heard you say****That my love was an addiction**I've always been known to do the right thing, and so my conscience has been clean.  I've felt good about myself for the things I've done.**When we cling our love is strong**When my heart and my mind don't contradict one another, I function incredibly well.**When you go you're gone forever**Should I ignore my conscience this time, I may end up without one at all.**You string along****You string _PERSON_ conscience is nagging at me.And then we have this part.**Every day is like survival****You're my lover not my rival****Every day is like survival****You're my lover not my rival**Here he's saying, ""My conscience is my guide, and my ally, yet I seem to be battling with it like an enemy.""So that's about it.  That's my theory.  In reality, it's probably just a song about a relationship in which two people fight all the time or something, but I thought this was a fun interpretation of the lyrics.  Hope you enjoyed."

Preferably on PC.I'd like to play a survival or survival horror kind of game.  Rather than playing an action-packed survival game, I'm looking for something where you spend the majority of your time (or 50/50) just scrounging for the necessities of survival.  It would be mostly quiet, and then every once in a while I'd get hit by a swarm of zombies or infected or aliens or something.  I don't want an action-packed game, and I don't want to play as a superhero or a commando.  Just a guy trying to get by in a post apocalypse or something.If there's anything out there like this that you guys know of, or even something vaguely close, I'd be grateful.  Thanks!"

3fuey3,46849,FanTheories,1438754623,[Dragon Ball Z]_PERSON_'s conception is a bit unnerving. And possible explanations for _PERSON_ and _PERSON_'s early transformations.,"In Dragon Ball Z, _PERSON_ is most definitely conceived at some point during the Cell Saga.  I believe that _PERSON_ is conceived in the 9 day period before the Cell Games begin, when _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ are relaxing after their hyperbolic training session.Given the circumstances, there's pretty much no time for _PERSON_ between _PERSON_'s birth, and _PERSON_'s death, aside from that 10 day period.  So, it stands to reason that _PERSON_ was conceived... while _PERSON_ was a _PERSON_ Saiyan.  I think that _PERSON_'s ability to achieve SSJ so easily can be attributed to the fact that _PERSON_ was _PERSON_ Saiyan when _PERSON_ was conceived.  I'm not saying that _PERSON_'s ability to turn _PERSON_ before _PERSON_'s conception is the reason for _PERSON_'s ease of transformation, like many people believe.  No, I believe it's because _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ were in a state of perpetual _PERSON_ Saiyan during that period.  _PERSON_ banged _PERSON_ while in his _PERSON_ Saiyan form, and his powered up sperm impregnated her, and spawned a powered up kid.  _PERSON_ wasn't raised around _PERSON_, and _PERSON_ had given up fighting and training, so what excuse does _PERSON_ have for being so strong?  We see that his first transformation came when sparring with his mom, but she's not quite at _PERSON_'s level of power, which is what _PERSON_ needed to reach when he transformed the first time.  So why was it so easy?  Well, that's why.  He was conceived by a _PERSON_ Saiyan, in _PERSON_ Saiyan form.Now that I can hear you all groaning, and saying ""that doesn't explain _PERSON_, you idiot!""  Well, I've got an explanation for _PERSON_, too._PERSON_ has _PERSON_ for a father.  _PERSON_ is a seriously tough dude, and never stops training.  _PERSON_ idolizes his father and strives to be like him, and even trains alongside him.  _PERSON_ has undergone real training and has experienced his father's tough love, and super saiyan transformations.Look at the circumstances!  _PERSON_ is raised in the countryside, with his toughest training coming from _PERSON_ (until _PERSON_ before the tournament).  Then you have _PERSON_ who has *_PERSON_ for a father.*  **_PERSON_.**  And _PERSON_'s power is just barely below _PERSON_'s.  _PERSON_ says so himself when _PERSON_ asks about it.  _PERSON_ is only a little stronger, and he's a year older.  They're nearly equals, and there's no excuse for _PERSON_ to be that close to _PERSON_'s power when _PERSON_ is exposed to real training, and _PERSON_ spars with his wacky mom.This is all purely hypothetical, and I'm sure there's a ton of evidence to the contrary somewhere, but I'm filing this under headcanon until I have reasonable doubt."
3g5f2t,46849,dbz,1438968116,Something interesting I caught during the pre-buu World Tournament.,"Two things.The first thing is that we can reasonably assume at the time of this tournament, _PERSON_ is the strongest.  When they're testing on the punch machine, _PERSON_ scores the *lowest* of all the Z Fighters.  I found this interesting.  I think it's cool because it implies that even though he's the strongest, he has the most control and restraint over his power.  _PERSON_ much the perfect contrast to _PERSON_'s punch...Another thing that happens is when they first meet _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ get really intense and feel apprehensive about them, but _PERSON_ says something along the lines of, ""ehh, they don't seem that scary to me.""Well, it's easy to dismiss this as _PERSON_ being less skilled than they are, and not being able to tell.  Actually... _PERSON_ turned out to be right.When _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ see the power of the Saiyans, it blows them away.  They're completely caught off guard.  The Kais are nowhere near as strong as the last remaining Saiyans, and since that's _PERSON_'s most likely frame of reference, he didn't really think much of them.  His Ki is sort of desensitized from knowing _PERSON_, Gohan, and _PERSON_ perhaps.This is a lot of speculation, but they were a couple of cool minor notes I caught.  I love rewatching!"

We act on behalf of a client with access to very substantial funds, who has indicated his wish to sponsor a project to introduce salmon, and the sport of salmon fishing, into the Yemen.We recognise the challenging nature of such a project, but we have been assured that the expertise exists within your organisation to research and project manage such work, which of course would bring international recognition and very ample compensation for any fisheries scientists who became involved. Without going into any further details at this time, we would like to seek a meeting with you to identify how such a project could be initiated and resourced, so that we may report back to our client and seek further instructions.We wish to emphasise that this is regarded by our client, who is a very eminent Yemeni citizen, as a flagship project for his country. He has asked us to make clear that there will be no unreasonable financial constraints. The Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office supports this project as a symbol of Anglo-Yemeni cooperation.  _PERSON_ sincerely*(Ms) _PERSON_ Centre for Fisheries Excellence  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  Smith Square  London* *Ms _PERSON_  Fitzharris &amp; Price  Land Agents &amp; Consultants  St James’s Street  London*   1 June Dear Ms Chetwode-TalbotDr Jones has asked me to thank you for your letter dated 15 May and reply as follows.Migratory salmonids require cool, well-oxygenated water in which to spawn. In addition, in the early stages of the salmon life cycle, a good supply of fly life indigenous to northern European rivers is necessary for the juvenile salmon parr to survive. Once the salmon parr evolves into its smolt form, it then heads downriver and enters saltwater. The salmon then makes its way to feeding grounds off Iceland, the Faroes or Greenland. Optimum sea temperatures for the salmon and its natural food sources are between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius.We conclude that conditions in the Yemen and its geographical location relatively remote from the North Atlantic make the project your client has proposed unfeasible, on a number of fundamental grounds. We therefore regret we will be unable to help you any further in this matter.  _PERSON_ sincerely*Ms _PERSON_ (Assistant to Dr Jones)*--- **Office of the Director, National Centre for Fisheries Excellence**  *From: _PERSON_  To: Dr _PERSON_  Subject: Fitzharris &amp; Price/Salmon/Yemen  Date: 3 June* AlfredI have just received a call from _PERSON_, who is private secretary to the parliamentary undersecretary of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.The FCO view is very clear that this project is to be given our fullest consideration.

(They can't come to terms with the fact I'm going to a small university they haven't heard of next year, instead of the Ivy League school they'd imagined for me.)I care about my friends deeply. This week, I found out that one has been lying to me about major things for the last few months because he doesn't actually trust me – he'd told me I was the only one who he could confide in, and it turns out that was all a huge lie that everyone was in on but me. Another was getting into major shit, so I did my best to get her out. She says she's sorting things out now, but she doesn't want to be friends any more. One of my closest friends of all has been making excuses about why we aren't in touch for the last two months and I feel like I barely know them any more. And the one who I care about most of all wishes I didn't and couldn't possibly be less interested in my own life.At this point, there's pretty much nobody out there who has done anything to suggest any remote interest in me as a human being, and I don't know if there has been for a long, long time now.

I don't have anything to look forward to tomorrow, or the day after, or any day after that, really.I guess I am what you would call lonely. Lonely.

It's not related to my job, so it'll eat up most of my vacation days for the year. However, I do have approximately 2-4 extra days which I'd like to take before the conference to explore part of Europe I haven't been to. The idea would be to fly to whatever place, then train/fly to Paris for my conference. I have a budget of about $1500 for the 2-4 days bit, which has to include travel to Paris, but not include the travel from my country (Canada) to wherever in Europe. I will unfortunately have a lot of tech equipment and fancy clothes with me for this conference, so I'll need to stay in hotels (not hostels as I normally would).I like old cities/towns with character, and good hiking is a bonus, so I'm thinking Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, something like that? I don't drive, so walkable places or places with good transit are good - I only have 2-4 days, remember. I'm 20 and have travelled quite a bit in Europe: all of Scandinavia, and then some of Estonia, Spain, Austria, France and the UK. My favourite city in Europe so far is actually Barcelona, which I love for its vibrant lively atmosphere, good food, beautiful architecture and walkability. Bonus points for somewhere I won't be totally swamped by other tourists (this is around the middle of July I'd be there). Totally comfortable being ""fish-out-of-water"" and weather is no concern.

So I'm going to try and avoid that, although I'm 20 and have been in your shoes, so may fail.I know it seems like lots of people around you are dating, and it seems like however old you are is too old to not have been kissed, and it seems like it must be your fault somehow - you're too weird or ugly or uncool or whatever. And yup, sometimes maybe you have a weird smile and it puts people off, or you dress kinda weird and it doesn't look good, or you suck at makeup, or have a bad haircut, and this may indeed play a contributing factor in why members of your preferred gender aren't expressing interest in you. That's where subreddits like this are useful.But the fact is, for most of you, it's because you're young and just haven't met enough people yet. Love and dating and all that? It's largely a numbers game. If you think 1 in 50 boys/girls are dateable, and they think 1 in 50 are dateable, that means only in 1 in 2500 potential couples both consider the other dateable *and many of those may already be dating someone*. The single best thing teenagers can do to help find themselves find love is ***learn to be truly happy without it***. It's silly to let other people determine your self-worth. And anyway, happy fun people beget happy fun people. Happy people who are having a good time and enjoying life are far more likeable than self-conscious, reserved, sad people. Be happy and stop worrying - you'll find happiness eventually. I met my current (first serious) girlfriend when I was 19…worth the wait x a million."

It has its flaws (domestic and international travel is expensive if you're used to Europe, our winter is quite cold, etc.), but overall yes. For the most part, Canada has:  * Friendly, polite, accepting people* The most diverse population of any country in the world (really!)* Low crime (visitors are surprised that flower shops often leave all the flowers out overnight unprotected)* High quality of life (good food, culture, etc.)* Huge natural beauty and a love of the outdoors (more than almost anywhere else on earth)* Acceptable labour laws (much better than America, especially for minimum wage employees)* Excellent customer service (People who work in shops and restaurants, etc., are generally much friendlier here than anywhere else I've been - probably related to previous point)It's certainly not a perfect country, but I've travelled to ~30 countries and lived in four, and Canada is the only one I'd want to live in permanently. That said, you should definitely visit first! Canada is the second-largest country on Earth, and cities/regions are extremely different from each other: Canada has deserts, cities, farming areas, rainforests, fishing villages, suburbs, mountains, hundreds of islands, and more. I'll talk about my impressions of major locations of interest at the bottom of the post.  ###HOW DO I IMMIGRATE TO CANADA?  As is the case with almost every country on earth, you can't move to Canada without special permission from our government. There's no point getting too excited about Canadian life or spending a great deal of time discussing it if, in practice, you have no claim to Canadian residency. Step one is finding your local Canadian embassy/consulate/high commission, wherever you are. [This](_URL_ is the complete list of websites for Canadian foreign offices in every country that has one. Their staff and website will be of enormous assistance to you, and details (mostly about the third program) may vary depending on where you're from. They can help.Without further ado, the three main ways to live in Canada for more than a month or two, ranked from hardest to easiest:* As a [Temporary Foreign Worker](_URL_ Requires a job offer from a Canadian employer in advance. Unless your skills are in high demand or you have a strong international reputation for your work, it is difficult but not imposible to find a sponsored job here. Part of the process is that the employer has to demonstrate that a foreign employee is necessary for some reason (i.e. shortage of domestic employees in the field) - they must prove that the job was advertised substantially within Canada and that they were unable to fill it.  * As a [Federal Skilled Worker](_URL_ There are three streams of this: PhD students studying in Canada, those with an offer of employment, or those without an offer of employment but with experience in a ""Priority Occupation"" (i.e., something Canada needs more of). Here's a 2010 version of [that list](_URL_ There's no current version available because applications are temporarily closed for the Priority Occupation category until some time in early 2013 when rules may be changing. For FSW applicants, they grade your application out of 100. Anyone who gets above a 67 is generally accepted, on a first-come, first-serve basis until quotas for each category are filled. Here's [a sample test](_URL_ that can help you estimate what grade out of 100 you'd score. It'll ask how many years of full-time experience you have in an occupation with NOC codes of 0, A or B. To work out what qualifies, find your job [here](_URL_ (there's a search box too, bottom left sidebar) and if the 4-digit code starts with 0, or the second digit is 0, 1, 2 or 3, it counts for this question. For any category of FSW, you need at least one year of *full-time, paid* experience in a job that meets this regulation (starts with 0, or second digit 0/1/2/3). You'll get points for how well you speak our official languages - you only need to speak one, but you get more points if you have even some skills in the other (English and French). If your application is just below the 67 mark, take basic French lessons for a month.* [International Experience Canada](_URL_ (Working Holiday). Every year, thousands of people age 18-35 (age requirements may be more strict in some countries) can come live *and work* in Canada for up to 12 months. This is basically first-come, first-serve and NO QUALIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED. You can live and work anywhere in Canada, no limits, for 12 months, and do not need an employment offer in advance - it's up to you to find work. Each participating country is allocated a specific number of spaces per year  - check with your local Canadian foreign office for your country's info, or it should be on their website too. You may be able to reapply for further 12 month periods if you wish, but this is not guaranteed - speak with your Canadian embassy for details, as each participating country has different policies about reapplying.  ##Alternative: Study in Canada* Canada also receives 1000s of international students every year. [This page](_URL_ has all the details about how to study in Canada. I won't get into what universities are good and bad, but in my opinion, Canadian universities are very good quality, and cheap for international students compared to American or British schools (~$9,000-20,000 CAD per year for tuition). This is still quite expensive, which is why I don't list it as a standard method of coming to Canada. All you need is proof that you have been accepted to a Canadian educational institution, proof that you have enough money for school and living and return to your home after, no criminal record, and generally good health. There is no limit or quota for this program - Canada can accept all students who meet these requirements. You may be able to be employed while in Canada as a student, and the website linked has details on that too. After graduating, you can live in Canada for 3 more years and [may be eligible for permanent residency and citizenship after that](_URL_  ###WHERE SHOULD I LIVE?Canada is the second-largest country on Earth (after Russia). Although we are larger than the US, our population is approximately 10%. Approximately 75% of Canadians live within 160km (100 miles) of the US border. Brief comments about some popular cities:* Toronto: I'm from here and therefore biased. Largest city, pop. 5.6m. Built on a very large lake, over 100 parks, over 100 libraries, great nightlife, lots of culture, busy city. * Montréal: Extremely beautiful island city in Québec, pop. 3.8m. Hard but not impossible to find work here without good French. Historic city, with best nightlife in Canada and best arts scene. Relatively low cost of living. * Vancouver: Hosted 2010 Winter Olympics, pop. 2.3m. Expensive but great place to live. Big city, surrounded by _PERSON_ and ocean. Fantastic for outdoor-lovers.* Ottawa: Our capital, pop. 1.2 million. Major employer is government. Must visit while you're here as it's beautiful and the capital, but can be hard to find work - not recommended to move here unless seeking government work and/or you're bilingual.* Calgary: Home to Canada's resource extraction industry, pop. 1.2m. Possibly the easiest place to find employment due to rapid economic growth, but not a very exciting place to live. (Sorry, Calgary.)* Halifax, Charlottetown or St. John's: Some of the nicest small cities are in Atlantic Canada. Can be friendlier/easier to get to know. *A note about language:* Canada has two official languages, English and French. To immigrate, you will need good language skills in one language, but not necessarily both. Canadians use English in all areas of Canada except the province of Québec and some parts of the province of New Brunswick. (Outside of these areas, only 1 in 10 Canadians can have a conversation in French!) If you do not live in either of these places, English is normal and you will never need any French at all. ###HOW DO I GET A JOB IN CANADA?The answer to this varies depending on what job you're looking for, where, and your experience, but most employers will want a résumé listing your past jobs/experience/education, and a cover letter - same as in the US. The letter should introduce yourself and explain why you think you would be good for that specific job, ending with information about how to contact you. If the job is minimum wage (retail/food/etc.), the tone of the letter should be professional but friendly - Canada is casual compared to Europe, but a little more formal than the US, if that helps. Job websites in Canada include www.monster.ca www.craigslist.ca and _PERSON_ but there are many more."

The title is technically a lie - I don't work at the shop any more - but my info should be pretty up-to-date!I'm happy to suggest strollers, help with your existing one, or answer questions about the business: Why do I recommend you spend $200-800 on a stroller?

I would love to help but don't have the answers you're looking for.** **IS CANADA A BAD PLACE TO LIVE?**  Last time, we started with the benefits of life in Canada, and glossed over the negatives. So this time, I thought it might be helpful to start with some negatives. This was hard to write (because I'm a patriotic Canadian and couldn't think of much), so Canada-h8rs, please chime in. For the most part, Canada is:* Colder than you may be used to. Do *not* underestimate how frustrating this can be. Many immigrants really struggle with this. Not only is it unpleasant, it's a nuisance. In winter, we wake up 30-60 minutes early each morning to shovel our driveway (which can be hard, back-breaking work), and remove the ice and snow encrusted on our entire car. We may have to do the same upon leaving work. You are legally required to keep your sidewalk clear of snow and ice (for safety), which many mean shovelling daily. Public transport and roads are all much slower in winter. We have less sun in winter - it may be dark at 4:30 or 5pm depending on where you are. If you're from Iceland, this is no big deal, but if you're from Costa Rica, you may not enjoy this. * Kind of like a more boring, less famous USA. Try naming 10 famous things in America. Now try naming 10 in Canada. Sure, we have cool stuff here too, and I would always choose Canada over the USA, but it's never going to have the same glamour as moving to the USA. * Not free of bad people. It's a terrible tendency of this subreddit, and Reddit overall, to glamourize certain countries, Scandinavian countries and Canada especially. In my experience, Canadians are some of the nicest people on earth, but we DO have crime, we have corruption, we have rude people, we have racists, we have homophobes, we have sexists, and if you stay here long enough, you'll see all of them. Just like any other country.* More expensive, compared to the US and most non-European countries. This is very hard to quantify. Dollar-by-dollar, most things are cheaper in America. But our minimum wage is substantially higher, and people tend to get paid more for whatever in Canada than in the US (except in some fields, like medicine or law). But our taxes can be higher. But you don't have to worry about medical insurance, and our universities are cheaper. Our rent is hard to compare nation-to-nation. So it's all a bit complicated. But a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, a MacBook, your cell phone bill? All of these will cost more in Canada than in the US. (It's because distribution is expensive - Canada has EXTREMELY low population density. Small market spread over huge area.)**COST OF LIVING**  Actually, [this site](_URL_ does it better than I can. That link's for Toronto but they have other cities too. Cheaper than most of Europe, more expensive than Latin America or most of Asia. **DAY-TO-DAY LIFE**  A few people asked about what life is like day-to-day. This seems like a really boring section to me, being that it's my life, but who knows, maybe this will be different from what you're used to? If you're American, this'll be dull! I'll talk about a typical work day for me when I used to work in a shop in Toronto. **7:30am** Wake up. I live in a quiet, residential neighbourhood with tall trees lining the streets. Head downstairs and have some Cheerios and milk for breakfast, and maybe an orange. If I get up earlier, I have time to fry up an egg with toast, but normally I don't. Have a shower, shave, brush my teeth, get dressed, grab my bag. **8am** Leave the house. It's January so it's somewhere between 5C and, like, -12C, so a coat and waterproof boots are important, or else feet get wet from the snow. I walk three blocks to the bus stop, take the bus to the subway station (10m ride), and then take the subway four stops (8 minutes). Get off and wait 10 minutes for the second bus for about a 15 minute ride which stops outside where I work. This whole thing costs $3, or a monthly pass is about $125.**8:50am** Head into my local coffee shop, across the street from my job. The barista knows me because I come in most mornings, and greets me by name. We chat while she makes my drink ($3.50). I cross the street to show up for work.**9am** Work starts! I work in a store with mostly people my own age (18-25) and the managers are really great people, so this goes by pretty fast. I make minimum wage, which is $10.25/hr and lunch is unpaid, so that works out to around $90/day before tax. But I can also make commissions, so a good day might be $120. I work 9-6 with 30m for lunch and a 15m coffee break. I should bring my lunch with me but I'm lazy and normally go buy a crepe across the street for $7-8. Oops. The guy who owns the place is Swiss and also knows me by name.**6pm** I head home, same as above but in reverse, another $3. I cook dinner when I get home.**9pm** I might text friends to see if they want to meet up downtown and maybe go see a movie or hang out at a bar, or I might stay home and watch TV/go on Reddit if I'm lazy. Our drinking age is 18 or 19 depending on where you are. A normal, decent bar charges about $6 for a pint glass of beer, or $4-5 for a bottle. A rum and coke is normally $4-6. Movies are $8-15 depending on the cinema and if it's 3D. We have a lot of live music in Toronto, so sometimes I'll check event listings and see what's going on that night. I'll try to go home before 1:30am when public transit shuts down, because a cab home from downtown will be $15-20. Some nights, I bartend, which is a great job if you can get it. It's hard work from 8 or 9pm until 2am or 3am, but I can pull in $200-300+ with tips. **FUN IN CANADA**  [This video](_URL_ is actually a good place to start, showing Canadians having fun. These are Canadians, not tourists, in the video, but note that it's biased towards outdoorsy stuff (as opposed to cultural stuff), and that it shows ALL OF CANADA…so not all activities shown are possibly in all parts of Canada, obviously. In Toronto, we have many Broadway plays come direct from NYC. We have incredible live music across Canada, especially in the East, among our small island provinces. Montréal and Québec City are like a small part of idyllic France in Canada, with cobblestone streets, outdoor cafés, public gardens, and a tremendously active arts scene. In the West, we have the huge city of Vancouver surrounded by mountains - perfect for an urban nature-lover. Canadians are proud of and love their outdoors in all seasons. Most born-in-Canada Canadians I know can do at least two of skating, skiing and snowboarding. (And we'd be happy to teach you, too! I've taught at least three immigrant friends to skate.) Many middle-class and upper-class families own cottages, which are like small second homes in very rural areas, often ""closed"" in winter, that families drive to visit on weekends or during summer vacation. They tend to be on lakes, and many cottage owners use their cottage as a base to swim, canoe, sail, skidoo, seadoo, jetski, tube, fish, wakeboard, surf, trampoline, hike, hunt, etc. etc. Canadians will often invite friends to their family cottage. Many Canadians travel in winter to ski resorts on mountains for a few days of skiing/snowboarding and, for younger Canadians, partying. Canada is huge enough that whether you love museums and theatre, or surfing and hang-gliding, there's a part of Canada where you'll be happy. **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WATCHING**  [This video](_URL_ is an American news anchor, _PERSON_, explaining Canada for 6 minutes. It was recorded for the 2010 Winter Olympics, which were in Vancouver, Canada. It's an incredibly good explanation, makes me all tingly as a Canadian, and has a lot of great video of Canada. I cannot recommend this enough. **UNIVERSITIES IN CANADA**  [Part 1](_URL_ talks about how to study in Canada, but doesn't talk about universities. To summarize: about $9000-20,000 in tuition per year for int'l students, but you'll probably be able to permanently live and work in Canada after. Where should you study? That's a hard question even for Canadian students. Universities commonly included on Canadian students' ""top picks"" include University of Toronto, McMaster University, Queen's University, _PERSON_ University, _PERSON_ University, University of British Columbia, and University of Waterloo. (McMaster, Waterloo, Toronto, Queen's and _PERSON_ are particularly notable for sciences. Toronto, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and UBC are particularly notable for arts. Yes, Toronto and _PERSON_ are notable for both.) Those are all large universities of at least 20,000. I attended a small university and much preferred it - more personal attention, friendlier environment. Small schools worth considering are _PERSON_ (for visual art/design), _PERSON_, Memorial University (least expensive in Canada), Acadia University (especially for biology, kinesiology, business, music, music therapy, recreation management, pre-med), St. Francis Xavier, and _PERSON_. If you want a relatively large city and a small university, look at Memorial and _PERSON_. Let me know if you have any questions and I'll edit!"

If we took a break, in practice, neither of us would be with anyone else during that break.Anyone got any ideas or thoughts? Both of us want to be together come September.

There's lots of unpopular ones just a little further down.*  Because most of /r/amiugly's 30K subscribers only see the top 1 or 2 posts mixed in on their frontpage, rather than visiting /r/amiugly itself to see all of them. If the top post has 70 comments, that's all they see and click and comment on. Having the top post be one that doesn't need compliments damages odds of other people getting comments. *Won't people just game this system?*  Well, maybe, but this policy will not be written anywhere, so the majority of users won't know about it. It'll also be silently enforced – people aren't notified when their post is deleted. We have several such ""silent policies"" already in place to avoid gaming systems. (No, they aren't exciting…it's stuff like auto-removing links to certain websites that we find often normally lead to bad things, etc.)"
1f4t0o,46729,india,1369655589,Expat in Delhi: can anyone explain street addresses to me?,"So, for example, my address is 70/60, BC, 3rd Floor, (area), New Delhi.

On my street, some buildings are labelled with a B and some with a C, and mine has no sign on it at all! I also don't understand the ""70/60"" - what does it all mean?

As an /r/IAmA mod, every day when I wake up, I have to scroll down and down until I can find the last thing I remember reading. Then I go up, reading all messages, searching for ones that still haven't been dealt with and ignoring those that have. A better system would be something like a ticket-based concept where you see the oldest open ticket first, scrolling down to see newer and newer tickets. You could mark tickets as ""closed"" when the issue was resolved, and they would be archived, and could be flagged again if they received a reply."

So someone needs to write a straight-talk, no bullshit guidebook to how to get through all the awkward situations and other crap you go through every day. That person is me.

Now I also believe everyone has a price, Mine is $8.00 an hour. That is the price you need me to care. I'm not paid that. I'm minimum wage. (NY is 7.25) This makes me not give a crap. And don't say ""Your lucky to have a job"" Seriously, I can't live on this, and I live at home, there is no reason to be this broke.  Its gotten to the point where I don't care what my bosses think of me, cause really I don't think I'm paid enough to care. Your gonna ask me to work my ass off for so little, what you get is what you pay for. I show up regularly though, do what they ask without question unless I have something better going on.

I am 21 and have had no girlfriend, and this bothers me as it makes me feel unattractive and incapable of finding love. I'm worried I'm going to be unloved by not finding one person who decided to love me. At least for a little while. So now comes the reason I have decided to put this in r/_PERSON_. Shortly after my 21st birthday, I set a date. I decided to wait until September 10 to see if life improves or I would blow my brains out. the thought comes and goes now, but the date remains. So from this I'm not sure where to go. I think about telling my mother but the last time I told her of a failed hanging, everyone freaked out. So I don't want to tell anyone I know. Also I know enough to not go up to women and say ""Hey do you want to go out? if you say no I'm going to kill myself."" I have friends that are female but I'm usually friend zoned.

I wake up and Lydia isn't there. I'm going through a bit of withdrawal and I reach over to my pack for some hair of the cat. Everything has been ransacked. I grab my axe and rush outside.

So 60,000 is like nothing to the earth. So basically, in a blink of an eye we came on the scene and grew. Monkey humans came out and learned and got smart they became Human humans. Then all hell broke loose. Even faster then when we came on the scene, we changed and EXPLODED! 6,000 years? 6,000 years!? That's NOTHING! I know my number may be wrong, but still, how about this, in the time from where we made things out of stone, to plastics and space travel, we learned so much. And we are learning more at an even faster pace. Take slavery right? In America (I live there) blacks were slaves for hundreds of years, and humans had slaves in general for longer. in about 400 years Americans  learned that slavery isn't the best idea ever. Following that, from the civil war onward, we figured out black people are people too. along the way we also learned women count. I'm pretty sure we come from hanging everyone who doesn't look like us, to just yelling at them. Granted that's not great, but damn we learned fast. Even science. We went from thinking animals spontaneously appear in meat (real theory) to Genetic engineering. And it's getting faster all the time. 20 years ago I couldn't loose 20,000 songs in a couch. Now if I loose my Ipod, most of my music is gone. This may not much to do with atheism, but the same logic applies. we used to sacrifice 1,000s of people for a corn harvest. Now it's just appalling. We don't sacrifice animals anymore, we don't kill people as often as we used too. We may have messed up in the years, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ where bad, but now we find it horrific to do such acts. 6,000 years people, I think we learned a lot.Tl;DR I think humanity isn't as bad as it was, and in a short time we came from the jungles and are now learning to accept each other."

I have schizo-effective and because of that I go to a day program and have been going for some time. I am mandated by the state to go due to kendra's law (NY) So changing my psychiatrist isn't really an option for me. I will give you the rundown of the entire session with this psychiatrist.Almost as soon as we get started she asks me point blank ""Are you in the _PERSON_?"" As apparently there is someone who looks like me that goes the program. Also I've talked to other patients and shit like that is kind of the norm for her. After answering in the negative that I am not in fact a member of the _PERSON_. she asks me about my love life. (another issue I've been working on) And I went on three dates with a girl there and she asked if I loved her, I kinda did so I answered yes, but we decided to be just friends. This really set me off when she wanted to be friends but I'm over it. So my Psychiatrist said to forget her and find someone normal. She starts listing off places to meet ""Normal"" women and she mentioned church. I then said I was an atheist.She didn't expect this answer as I did used to go to bible study. (only to keep my dad happy, still haven't told him the news.) but she then informs me that she is Roman Catholic and asked if I ever read the bible. (On my to do list) I said no but she started on how I could I disagree with it if I never read it. I informed her of the things I didn't like about the bible, (_PERSON_ sodam and gammorra, how women are treated and stuff like that) She then told me not to be an ""Angry"" atheist and ended the session.I'm not really sure what I should do now. I don't want to deal with her again but I defiantly will read my bible in case this comes up again. We meet once a month and I really don't trust her. TL:DR I'm mandated to go to a day program, can't change psychiatrist, she took offense to my atheism.      Edit- I told my other social worker. We will be having a meeting the Monday after Labor Day. It will most likely be with my social worker, the other psychiatrist, the director of the program and her. Will post how it goes"
2rby18,22411,neckbeardstories,1420405096,Legbeard at the day program,"Hello everyone. Long time lurker first time sharer and all that. I just wanted to give you all a legbeard story that happened to me at a day program. PlayersNoisyteslacoil - Me (here refereed to as noisy) Schioz affective after a psycotic break and about a 2 month stay in the mental hospital, freshly released.   Viki - 30 year old legbeard at the programTo begin with, I went crazy and had to be admitted to the hospital after a psychotic break at my job as a telemarketer and got released into a day program. For those of you that don't know what a day program is, it is a place where they put crazy people (such as myself) in a big building with therapists and social workers and doctors and nurses to iron out any remaining issues we may have. It is widely known everyone there has issues and we try to play nice accordingly.  At the time I was very nervous and didn't know the unwritten rules, had no friends there and generally unsure f how to act. Also I didn't know how to say no to people and lost a lot of cigarettes that I will never get back. In comes Viki.  Viki was 30 years old, graying hair like straw, and would talk a lot but not about anything. I needed a friend desperately as I was new, she needed a friend desperately, so we found each other. This was a mistake.I don't remember our conversations but mostly they where about nothing and the stupid people that were at program. She was always complaining that she had no friends (good reason) and the program we both were at was full of ""retarded"" people. It should be noted that she was there longer then me. I was hoping to get out in a few months so I tried to play nice. I remember there was a lot of ""Yeahs."" and Uh-Huhs"" mostly by me. She would go on long rants about being bullied in middle school and I wasn't at the point where I could have told her to get over it as she is 30 and we have trained therapists to deal with this sort of thing. But as I reminded myself, she (as we all) had symptoms and I would be gone soon, or at least I hoped. *I dealt with her for a year.* She made my trips to program a nightmare. I couldn't make other friends as I learned no one wanted to be around her. People also thought we where dating. So it got to the point where I discussed it with my therapists and we I learned about ""I"" statements. Now an ""I"" statement is a nicer way of telling someone to fuck off. So instead of saying *Your creeping on me, I hate you.* it becomes *I don't appreciate the way your creeping on me.* I learned this through my therapists and so one day I just sat down with her and told her the truth. I wanted to make new friends and your stifling me. Viki got very depressed but it seemed like she had this conversation before. Almost immediately she left me alone and I made healthier friends. I still see her around the program, and I still hold onto hope that I'm getting out soon. But at least I don't have to deal with her anymore."
313ti4,22411,neckbeardstories,1427920006,"The dancing legbeard, or why you shouldn't eat hand sanitizer.","So this happened a few months back, you can find _PERSON_ for characters but I'll rehash it for this time. Me - Noisy - crazy person going to a day program. _PERSON_, dated for a bit but we are still coolViikky - Legbeard who befriended me when I first started going and prevented me from making friends due to her annoying nature and bad attitude and know-it-allness. she has a crush on me.So as I said in the introduction I am  crazy person going to a day program. Bizarre goings on is the norm there and everyone is more or less nice to each other. Except vikky, who just jumps into conversations and never leaves. I've had my run ins with her and can't stand her so when ever I have to talk to her I just give one word answers and leave. So me and _PERSON_ where sitting at the table in the lunch room chatting when _PERSON_ walks in and inserts herself into the conversation with a book she drew and illustrated. I should point out that _PERSON_ knows I don't like _PERSON_ so to make me squirm _PERSON_ invites _PERSON_ over but thankfully stopped after I talked to her about it. This was one of those times she got invited. _PERSON_ wrote a bok about a group of monkeys with a leader monkey that demanded that all the other monkeys shove fruit up its ass until it died and the group starved. Yeah...To her credit Viky's drawing where actually pretty good for just a pen and paper and if it was anyone else I would have found the story pretty funny. But as I can't stand her, I stared straight into the middle distance and let _PERSON_ do the talking. She said she used to do children's books but stopped as her stories got too weird. By now your wondering what this story has to do with hand sanitizer. This will make sense I promise. After the conversation moved on and _PERSON_ was just sitting there another client by the name of _PERSON_ started playing music on the end of the table. I don't remember the song, but it was one of those dancing songs sung by a famous black woman, I think it was shackeria? it was in the vein of that. So vikky starts dancing this odd dance that I suppose she think is sexy. but it's as sexy as _PERSON_ thatcher in a bikini. _PERSON_ is laughing her ass off, and looking at a bottle of hand sanitizer wondering what it tastes like. _PERSON_ notices me looking at the hand sanitizer and dares me to eat it. One thing you should know about me is that I will do anything anyone tells me to do. I play chicken with life, and so I will prove my manhood by eating this hand sanitizer. Women will throw themselves at me, men will want to become me, I'm no pussy, you're fucking on. So I put the bottle to my mouth to squirt some of it in and _PERSON_ squeezes the bottle and get a good mouth load of hand sanitizer in my mouth. _PERSON_ tastes disgusting. Also lemon._PERSON_ notices this and freaks out, thinking I'm going to die, gets me water and starts tearing up. I'm coughing and gagging. _PERSON_ is apologizing for putting so much in my mouth and laughing at the same time. MY other friend eddy walks up and has no idea whats going on. After that I go to group."
3fe001,22411,mylittlepony,1438416336,So I got my masculinity questioned by a 5 year old.,"So I work in an office. Most of my co-workers are older women and I have a cubical. After working there for a bit I needed to decorate my spot and naturally, ponies. After about a week or so of the usual questions regarding my hobby and the good natured ribbing, I became ""The guy who likes the ponies"" My ponies were a bit of a hit and could always be counted on for a topic of conversation. If I brought friends I would always give them one guess to find my desk. Anyway, I have this friend _PERSON_ who is a grandmother and she would always talk to me about Power Rangers or _PERSON_ as her five year old grandson was into them. _PERSON_'s motto regarding me was ""Let your freak flag fly."" Until one day she was telling me about her grandson and the topic of ""Boys toys"" and ""Girls toys"" came up. She asked him if MLP could ever be a ""Boy toy"" to which he answered ""no"". She then proceeded to tell him about the grown up with ponies on his desk. (I'm 24, hes 5, I'm a grown up) Just the mere concept of me just blew his little mind. He asks her everything regarding me and my love of the ponies. So after that when _PERSON_ would see her grandson and take him shopping they would spot pony related items in the wild, and he would always ask ""Would Noisyteslacoil like that?"" and whenever this conversation would happen, _PERSON_ would always tell me the next day. The best was when they saw a little girls nighty and He asked If I would wear it. (I might have if it came in adult sizes) So one day _PERSON_'s grandson is at the office near the end of the day, and I come over to say hi. I should mention I had VERY shaggy hair and a fair bit of it and was wearing a pony shirt. I didn't plan it that way, but it's my favorite shirt. He takes one look at my shirt, one look at the ponies on my desk, a look at me and slowly shakes his head and turns away. I'm sure he would have asked for my man card if he was sure I didn't already trade them for a pony bank or something. The look on his face said it all ""Girl toys? Really?"""

llvrd,35114,pharmacology,1319360415,Pharmacology: what should I be doing?,"Hey guys! I'm currently a high school senior interested in eventually getting into scientific research, specifically in pharmacology. I had the great opportunity of visiting the Skaggs School of Pharmacy at UCSD this summer (I know it's pharmacy, and there's a difference), and eventually, I at least figured out that pharmacology is the research and study of drug interactions in living systems, while pharmacy is the profession of administering, dosing, and applying drugs.My question is, what steps should I be taking in college to help me get a head start? I hope to major in either biochemistry or chemistry, but apart from that, I've had difficulty finding any other things I can do. So from that, I have a few basic questions:* Do I need to go to med school, or rather would I go to a school of pharmacy* How much further education will I need (master's, PhD?)* How much do other subjects like physics and mathematics matter?Thanks for reading and answering!10/24 EDIT: Wow thanks guys! Lots of useful info. From what I can read, a Pharm.D/PhD is the most useful, if I'm willing to put the time and effort in. This is interesting though:&gt; If you are serious about drugs and are interested in pharmacy/pharmacology don't waste your time getting a bachelors. Most schools allow you to take the pre-requisites (chem 1&amp;2, organic 1&amp;2, calc, physics, economics, biology 1&amp;2) for pharmacy school in two years and you can go straight to pharmacy school without a four year degree.Would this mean I would go to a pharmacy school within the same school, or I can apply to another pharmacy school right away?"

It was hard, but I'm considering using it later during the school year, and having our team use it as part of our normal practice. I'm not sure howf to change, modify, or what to make it more effective. The purpose here is to get a tough workout and to work on IM (obviously).

I don’t think you’d say I’m “sad” to any degree. But in past months, generally spending more time reading up on current events as well as trying to have serious discussion with my friends. But every time I try to remotely try and introduce something serious to talk about (living by ourselves, internet censorship, et alia), within minutes it derails into a huge, exaggerated conversation about how funny if someone did this about it, or how people should do unrealistic things to solve problems. Being in China, I’m stuck with internet censorship, a general inability to protest or do any sort of activism without fearing of risk of prosecution or any sort of negative attention from the police. I don’t want to put my future at risk, or my parents and friends at risk as well.All of this has come to a head in the past day with the whole _PERSON_ bullshit. Yes, he needs to be killed _PERSON_ the Impaler style, I believe that he should have his eyes gouged out and sulfuric acid poured into his skull as well, but what about all the other atrocious acts going on right this minute? It’s impossible not only for myself to get anything done, but to even have serious, intellectual discourse with the people I am closest to. I figure it’d be easier on everybody if I just leap out my window, rather than have them deal with my _PERSON_: world seems hopelessly broken beyond the point of any return to me, and my friends are hopelessly mired in their immaturity. Seems easier to me to just go out and not deal with all this.Call me a coward, but honestly, if I could even find one person who could speak along the same lines as I do, it’d make this a whole lot better.

I say this since I lived in China for a long time (8 years), and it took quite a while and a decent amount of money to figure out what to do (buying, modding, tools, anything else you can think of relating to building a computer). Some of these are pretty universal, like what tools you'll need and the basic steps to building a computer, but things like where to buy parts, tips and tricks for specific locations, these are the sort of things that could be collated into a small guide. I can only think of what online vendors/sites people can use to order parts, and maybe some unique things to different areas/cities. For instance, where I lived (Shanghai), there were several huge electronic markets where small vendors rented a small booth, and sold their wares. It was a good place to find rumors about technology in Shanghai, and make sure you were getting legitimate parts.Such a guide/guides could just be placed in the sidebar in its own category, or a notice for people in different countries, with a link to the country guides.Alternatively, maybe creating another subreddit, like buildapcabroad or something would be useful to international people, given there are enough people with enough experience in different countries to help out."

PCPartPicker has a pretty good selection of areas that serve the majority of people here (probably), but other than that, other places are left a bit in the cold.

20hrg0,42155,DarkNetMarkets,1394905785,BlueSky Market review,"This isn't a vendor review, but a market one. I had a great experience with this site and thought I would share my experience. I really like this site and it shows a great deal of promise. Firstly, I should point out that PGP keys are not stored in vendors profile so if you don't see them don't worry. They are available when you message a vendor or when you enter your address. Moreover, you can download the .asc so its easy to use with bash. As for deposits they are very quick, but do require you to click a check for deposit button. However, unlike SR the site itself makes it very clear you have to push a button to check for deposits.  Withdrawals on the other hand were not immediate, but this was made clear after I withdrew the funds. I should note that the withdrawal had 0 taint from my deposit address so the site functions like a mixer as well :). Now for the purchasing process. When you make a purchase your funds are not immediately removed from your balance. Instead it locks in the price for a couple of hours. This allows you to make a deposit right before you are about to purchase without having to worry about price fluctuations. Once you have the correct about of bitcoins you are then able to pay. Also, you are able to submit you address at any point of this process. I should also point out that addresses MUST be encrypted. I haven't had a chance to leave feedback yet so I can not describe that process yet. However, I like how the feedback on the site is presented. First, the site displays the buyers rating along with their FB rating. I'm not exactly sure how buyer rating is calculated, but it could be based off of number of transactions. It looks similar to the way BMR did feedback, there is a green or red star with a number. Anyway, what sets it apart is that there are rating for sub categories like stealth and communication. The site also shows the total number of disputes and the number of dispute in the previous 2 weeks. I think this is very useful and would love for other sites to include this. Next I will cover some misc. features and item listings. This site, like most others lets you display domestic only. Additionally, the site allows you to save your favorite vendors. This is a feature that is often overlooked and is one I thoroughly enjoy. As for the listings, everything seems to be based on weight (or units if its pills or blotters). You have the option of displaying in grams or ounces. What's more is the site shows the price per gram or unit. I think this is pretty neat and useful. Also, the items show the price in both fiat AND bitcoin. I find this particular feature very useful and convenient since I no long need a calculator to convert the price back an forth. The search is also very nice because you can search by price range, minimum vendor rating, and minimum product rating. The search is contextual as well. Finally, they have an ""incognito"" which can be enabled before you login. What this does is removes all the drug pictures, which is useful if your in public or around other people. I will conclude with some of my criticisms. Firstly and probably most importantly, there appears to be some glitch in listings. For some reason several of the listings seem to have duplicates so you tend to see some items are listed multiple times. I was reading on the hub about how there is a delay between making a listing and when that listing is displayed. I think this is causing vendors to post their listings multiple times. The BSM representatives say the delay is the result of caching the listing (this is done for performance reasons). Also, there is a bug which causes you to log out. This only seems to happen whenever I am inpatient and click links multiple times in succession. Overall, I think this is a very good site. I definitely like it more than agora and _PERSON_ not only because its much faster, but it has a great deal more functionality. They also have a responsive support team. I should point out they do not have a forum. I believe their reasoning is they want to focusing solely on the market. That said, they have representatives here on reddit and on the hub."

2iq7gh,42155,DarkNetMarkets,1412825319,"Feds 'Hacked' Silk Road Without a Warrant? Perfectly legal, Prosecutors Argue","With only a month until the scheduled trial of _PERSON_, the alleged creator of the Silk Road drug site, Ulbricht’s defense lawyers have zeroed in on the_PERSON_argument that the U.S. government illegally hacked the billion-dollar black market site_PERSON_to expose the location of its hidden server. The prosecution’s latest rebuttal to that argument takes an unexpected tack: they claim that even if the FBI did hack the Silk Road without a warrant—and prosecutors are careful not to admit they did—that intrusion would be a perfectly law-abiding act of criminal investigation.On Monday evening the prosecutors submitted the latest in a series of combative court filings from the two sides of the Silk Road case that have clashed over Ulbricht’s Fourth Amendment right to privacy. The government’s new argument responds to an affidavit from an expert witness, tech lawyer _PERSON_, brought in by Ulbricht’s defense to poke holes in the FBI’s story of how it located the Silk Road server. In a letter filed last week, Horowitz called out inconsistencies in the_PERSON_FBI’s account of stumbling across the Silk Road’s IP address_PERSON_while innocently entering “miscellaneous data” into its login page. He testified that the FBI’s actions instead sounded more like common hacker intrusion techniques. Ulbricht’s defense has called for an evidentiary hearing to cross examine the FBI about the operation.In the government’s rebuttal, however, Ulbricht’s prosecutors don’t directly contest Horowitz’ description of the FBI’s investigation, though they do criticize his testimony in passing as “factually and analytically flawed in a number of respects.” Instead, they obliquely argue that the foreign location of the site’s server and its reputation as a criminal haven mean that Ulbricht’s Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches don’t apply, even if the FBI did use hacking techniques to penetrate the Silk Road, and did so without a warrant.“Even if the FBI had somehow ‘hacked’ into the [Silk Road] Server in order to identify its IP address, such an investigative measure would not have run afoul of the Fourth Amendment,” the prosecutors’ new memo reads. “Given that the SR Server was hosting a blatantly criminal website, it would have been reasonable for the FBI to ‘hack’ into it in order to search it, as any such ‘hack’ would simply have constituted a search of foreign property known to contain criminal evidence, for which a warrant was not necessary.” ..._URL_"

Just last week, Ulbricht’s lawyers went so far as to contend that the FBI had illegally hacked a Silk Road server in Iceland without a warrant to determine its location.&gt;But the Judge’s rejection of that argument comes down to what may be seen as a fateful technicality: she argues that even if the FBI did hack the Silk Road server, Ulbricht hadn’t sufficiently demonstrated that the server belonged to him, and thus can’t claim that his privacy rights were violated by its search. “Defendant has…brought what he must certainly understand is a fatally deficient motion to suppress [evidence],” the judge writes. “He has failed to take the one step he needed to take to allow the Court to consider his substantive claims regarding the investigation: he has failed to submit anything establishing that he has a personal privacy interest in the Icelandic server or any of the other items imaged and/or searched and/or seized.”_URL_"

Another strength is dealing over IM (w/ OTR) provides encryption for everything and its probably easier than PGP. &gt;Silk Roads come and Silk Roads go. But after every law enforcement crackdown shakes the dark web, one Russian black market always seems to survive.&gt;For more than two and a half years, the Russian Anonymous Marketplace, or RAMP, has maintained a thriving business in the Dark Web drug trade, offering one of the Internet’s widest arrays of narcotics to its Russian-speaking clientele. That’s roughly as long a tenure online as the original Silk Road achieved before it was seized in an FBI bust in October of last year. And it’s far longer than the new generation of anonymous drug markets that followed the Silk Road, including more than a dozen sites taken down last week in a massive coordinated police action. The largest of those seized sites, Silk Road 2, lasted exactly one year to the day.&gt;RAMP, which like those sites runs on the anonymity software Tor, has outlived its western counterparts to amass more than 14,000 members.

2yn1go,42155,DarkNetMarkets,1426044147,The CIA is giving its surveillance tech to US law enforcement,"Not directly related to the darknet, but it is relevant. Not only is the scope of the project outrageous, but the price is as well ($100 million). Looks like the only safe form of communication these days is face to face in a room that blocks telecommunications or carrier pigeons. &gt;The Justice Department's newest electronic dragnet--plane-mounted ""dirtboxes"" that can slurp thousands of cellular phone ID's from the air -- was originally developed by the CIA to hunt terrorists in the Middle East,_PERSON_The Wall Street Journal_PERSON_reports. Now however, it's being used domestically to track American citizens. That's not good.&gt;According to a new report from_PERSON_the_PERSON_WSJ, the US Marshals Service, with assistance from both the CIA and Boeing, developed these Cessna-mounted devices. They are electronic sniffers that mimic cellular tower signals to incite any cellular telephone within range to broadcast its identifying registration information. It's essentially an aerial man-in-the-middle attack and one that has cost US taxpayers more than $100 million to create. With this information, US Marshals can effectively locate, identify, and lock on to specific cell phones -- out of a sample population of thousands or even tens of thousands of devices -- to within an accuracy of just three yards. What's more, once the suspect phone is found, Marshals can then listen in on any calls originating from it._PERSON_According to theWSJ, these devices have been in operation since 2007, mounted on Cessna aircraft flying out of five metropolitan airfields throughout the US and can access a majority of the US population.&gt;This isn't the first time that this technology has been put to use by US officials, mind you. _PERSON_ technology first debuted in the Middle East where it was utilized in the hunt for terrorists in both Afghanistan and Iraq. However, this new program marks a troubling collaboration between domestic law enforcement and the nation spy agency that blurs a very important operational distinction between the two agencies.&gt;That is, the CIA is an outward-looking agency; its purpose is to gather information from abroad regarding external threats to national security. The US Marshals (and the DOJ in general), instead is tasked with enforcing federal law here in the States.

2za44l,42155,DarkNetMarkets,1426542800,RAPTOR: Routing Attacks on Privacy in Tor,"I didn't have an opportunity to read the article, but this attack seems to take place while the data is in transit. &gt; The Tor network is a widely used system for anonymous communication. However, Tor is known to be vulnerable to attackers who can observe traffic at both ends of the communication path. In this paper, we show that prior attacks are just the tip of the iceberg. We present a suite of new attacks, called Raptor, that can be launched by Autonomous Systems (ASes) to compromise user anonymity. First, AS-level adversaries can exploit the asymmetric nature of Internet routing to increase the chance of observing at least one direction of user traffic at both ends of the communication. Second, AS-level adversaries can exploit natural churn in Internet routing to lie on the BGP paths for more users over time. Third, strategic adversaries can manipulate Internet routing via BGP hijacks (to discover the users using specific Tor guard nodes) and interceptions (to perform traffic analysis). We demonstrate the feasibility of Raptor attacks by analyzing historical BGP data and Traceroute data as well as performing real-world attacks on the live Tor network, while ensuring that we do not harm real users. In addition, we outline the design of two monitoring frameworks to counter these attacks: BGP monitoring to detect control-plane attacks, and Traceroute monitoring to detect data-plane anomalies. Overall, our work motivates the design of anonymity systems that are aware of the dynamics of Internet routing._URL_"
2ztr5m,42155,DarkNetMarkets,1426961702,HACKING BIOS CHIPS ISN’T JUST THE NSA’S DOMAIN ANYMORE,"&gt;THE ABILITY TO hack the BIOS chip at the heart of every computer is no longer reserved for the NSA and other three-letter agencies. Millions of machines contain basic BIOS vulnerabilities that let anyone with moderately sophisticated hacking skills compromise and control a system surreptitiously, according to two researchers.&gt;The revelation comes two years after a catalogue of NSA spy tools leaked to journalists in Germany surprised everyone with its talk about the NSA’s efforts to infect BIOS firmware with malicious implants.&gt;The BIOS boots a computer and helps load the operating system. By infecting this core software, which operates below antivirus and other security products and therefore is not usually scanned by them, spies can plant malware that remains live and undetected even if the computer’s operating system were wiped and re-installed.&gt;BIOS-hacking until now has been largely the domain of advanced hackers like those of the NSA. But researchers _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ presented a proof-of-concept attack today at the CanSecWest conference in Vancouver, showing how they could remotely infect the BIOS of multiple systems using a host of new vulnerabilities that took them just hours to uncover. They also found a way to gain high-level system privileges for their BIOS malware to undermine the security of specialized operating systems like Tails—used by journalists and activists for stealth communications and handling sensitive data.&gt;Although most BIOS have protections to prevent unauthorized modifications, the researchers were able to bypass these to reflash the BIOS and implant their malicious code.&gt;_PERSON_ and _PERSON_ recently left MITRE, a government contractor that conducts research for the Defense Department and other federal agencies, to launch LegbaCore, a firmware security consultancy. They note that the recent discovery of a firmware-hacking tool by _PERSON_ researchers makes it clear that firmware hacking like their BIOS demo is something the security community should be focusing on.&gt;Because many BIOS share some of the same code, they were able to uncover vulnerabilities in 80 percent of the PCs they examined, including ones from Dell, Lenovo and HP. The vulnerabilities, which they’re calling incursion vulnerabilities, were so easy to find that they wrote a script to automate the process and eventually stopped counting the vulns it uncovered because there were too many.&gt;“There’s one type of vulnerability, which there’s literally dozens of instances of it in every given BIOS,” says _PERSON_. They disclosed the vulnerabilities to the vendors and patches are in the works but have not yet been released. _PERSON_ says, however, that even when vendors have produced BIOS patches in the past, few people have applied them.&gt;“Because people haven’t been patching their BIOSes, all of the vulnerabilities that have been disclosed over the last couple of years are all open and available to an attacker,” he notes. “We spent the last couple of years at MITRE running around to companies trying to get them to do patches. They think BIOS is out of sight out of mind [because] they don’t hear a lot about it being attacked in the wild.”&gt;An attacker could compromise the BIOS in two ways—through remote exploitation by delivering the attack code via a phishing email or some other method, or through physical interdiction of a system. In that case, the researchers found that if they had physical access to a system they could infect the BIOS on some machines in just two minutes. This highlights just how quickly and easy it would be, for example, for a government agent or law enforcement officer with a moment’s access to a system to compromise it.&gt;Their malware, dubbed LightEater, uses the incursion vulnerabilities to break into and hijack the system management mode to gain escalated privileges on the system. System management mode, or SMM, is an operations mode in Intel processors that firmware uses to do certain functions with high-level system privileges that exceed even administrative and root-level privileges, _PERSON_ notes. Using this mode, they can rewrite the contents of the BIOS chip to install an implant that gives them a persistent and stealth foothold. From there, they can install root kits and steal passwords and other data from the system.&gt;But more significantly, SMM gives their malware the ability to read all data and code that appears in a machine’s memory. This would allow their malware, _PERSON_ points out, to subvert any computer using the Tails operating system—the security and privacy-oriented operating system _PERSON_ and journalist _PERSON_ used to handle NSA documents _PERSON_ leaked. By reading data in memory, they could steal the encryption key of a Tails user to unlock encrypted data or swipe files and other content as it appears in memory. Tails is meant to be run from a secure USB flash drive or other removable media—so that conceivably it won’t be affected by viruses or other malware that may have infected the computer. It operates in the computer’s memory and once the operating system is shut down, Tails scrubs the RAM to erase any traces of its activity. But because the LightEater malware uses the system management mode to read the contents of memory, it can grab the data while in memory before it gets scrubbed and store it in a safe place from which it can later be exfiltrated. And it can do this while all the while remaining stealth.&gt;“Our SMM attacker lives in a place nobody checks today to see if there’s an attacker,” _PERSON_ says. “System management mode can read everyone’s RAM, but nobody can read System Management Mode’s RAM.”&gt;Such an attack shows, he says, that the operating system _PERSON_ chose to protect himself can’t actually protect him from the NSA or anyone else who can design an attack like LightEater.[Wire](_URL_ is pretty big news and could have major ramifications for market operators and bigger DNM vendors.  I can see the FBI seeking assistance from private security companies to help them launch this type of attack.  What really makes this attack scary is that not only is not not detected (unless your in the habit of inspecting your BIOS firmware), but it is persistent. There really isn't even an assuredly way to remove this piece of malware aside from buying a completely new piece of hardware.  Even then you wouldn't be able to use any piece of hardware (USB stick w/ tails) that came in contact with that piece of hardware.  I should note, that buyers shouldn't worry too much about this type of attack.*edit:* Yes, I am aware that modern computer (should at least) be using UEFI for booting.  However, many people who use Tails revert to legacy boot.  This removes the security features offered by UEFI (code signing)."

He responded through the support ticket:&gt;“I utilize TOR for privacy. Don’t particularly want NSA looking over my shoulder :)”&gt;_PERSON_ management found this message to be, well, incredibly weird. His account was blocked at this point (and unblocked and blocked again repeatedly for the rest of the month). At some point, _PERSON_ notified law enforcement, and the investigation into Force began.&gt;￼2) We now have the Torchat logs that document how the _PERSON_ fake murder-for-hire went down.&gt;For over a year, the media has been all over the story of how the Dread Pirate Roberts issued a hit on a rogue employee. We now know that _PERSON_, a/k/a Flush, a/k/a chronicpain, didn’t steal from DPR—he took the blame for something a crooked Secret Service Agent did. And then, as has been widely reported, the agent and his colleague helped fake the murder. We now have the Torchat logs that show messages sent by DPR immediately after the theft, leading up to him issuing a hit through a hitman who was actually Agent Force undercover.&gt;(The Torchats have been extracted from the docket update and are embedded at the end of this post).&gt;3) Wait… did DPR pay for that murder-for-hire with a_PERSON_bank wire transfer?&gt;This one doesn’t exactly come from unsealed docket, but the newly released Torchats don’t contain anything to contradict this gem, lending some credence to this, and making it more than possible that this little snippet isn’t a typo or misunderstanding on the part of prosecutors:￼&gt;Did the Dread Pirate Roberts, who was so insistent on anonymity and security through Tor, PGP encryption, and _PERSON_ actually use a_PERSON_bank wire transfer_PERSON_to pay for hismurder-for-hire?

The “real identity” that Force tried to use against DPR was taken directly from the investigation’s internal files. This is literally who law enforcement thought DPR was.￼&gt;We know from the trial that Anand Athavale is the real life identity of mises.org poster “libertystudent,” whose blog can be foundhere. Why did the Silk Road investigation think it was him? A language analysis, that showed both occasionally spelled “a lot” as “alot,” “labor” as “labour,” “real time” as “real-time,” “let me” as “lemme,” “phony” as “phoney,” and “route” as “rout.” Both liked to end sentences with “, right?” Both used terms like “intellectual laziness,” “agorism,” agorist,” “counter-economics,” “altruistic,” “phoney,” “paleo-human,” and “anarcho-capitalist.”&gt;They also both occasionally used all-caps for emphasis, didn’t capitalize the first word in sentence when in a hurry, and used “the symbol for backslash on the computer to split words with similar meaning.”&gt;They also discussed authors _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ of the Internet beware. The Feds are watching.&gt;6) _PERSON_’s theft led directly to DPR issuing a hit on _PERSON_. And this was ruled as not relevant to _PERSON_ trial at all.&gt;The extent of_PERSON__PERSON_ and Force’s corrupt activities is nothing short of astounding. It’s hard to pick the most outrageous allegation in the Department of Justice’s case against them, but the part where Agent _PERSON_ stole bitcoin from the Silk Road and _PERSON_ took the blame is definitely one of the front-runners. DPR issued a hit on Green, hiring_PERSON__PERSON_’s colleague _PERSON_ was undercover at the time. And then _PERSON_ and Force faked the murder.&gt;None of this was known by the defense until five weeks before the trial, and they were gagged from mentioning at trial because the grand jury investigation into Force and _PERSON_ was still under seal. The U.S. Attorney argued that all of this was “irrelevant and inflammatory,” and couldn’t possibly exculpate Ulbricht. The judge agreed, saying “defendant has failed to make a showing of ‘particularized need’ sufficient to overcome the presumption of secrecy.”&gt;When the defense moved for the trial to be postponed until the grand jury investigation of Force and _PERSON_ was complete, the prosecutors invoked “the people’s right to a speedy trial.”&gt;7) Everything important is still redacted, and we don’t know if Ulbricht will get a new trial.&gt;Is the Force/_PERSON_ scandal exculpatory for Ulbricht?

However, I would like to explain why I think the mdparity may have been compromised.Those of you who have been around awhile can skip or skim this paragraph because they are probably familiar with this episode.  When _PERSON_ first opened, there was a troll/script kiddie [whyusheep] (very similar to hacks4crack) who was wreaking havoc on darknet markets trying to show off his l337 skills.  Coincidentally, two of the markets he may have ""hacked"" were seized by LE or were _PERSON_.  Anyway, he discovered and irresponsibly disclosed a misconfiguration on _PERSON_'s server (more information on that in the paragraph after the next one).  This started a battle between mdparity and whyusheep.  Whyusheep was trolling mdparity pretty hard and had a ""mental"" break down.  I don't remember exactly what was said or if he exposed anything, but this does call into question his judgment.  Indeed, I remember whyusheep posting hints about finding linkedin (maybe other social media too) profiles related to mdparity. Mdparity said they were red herrings. In my opinion I think mdparity was honest because the profiles and tracks were a little too obvious.  Now back to that misconfiguration whyusheep exposed.  I don't think many people recognized this as a serious issue, but it was.  For those who don't remember, whyusheep found a way to list the server's directories content them ( [this is what I mean](_URL_~archive/atari/) ) In addition, the scripts were world readable.  This may seem trivial to non-technical people, but I'm sure the tech savvy people realize the problem this posses.  This allowed anyone to download the scripts themselves, which can be examined for vulnerabilities [easier to find vulnerabilities with the source], sensitive information leak, and coding style.  Remember, _PERSON_'s SR code had an hardcoded IP, which lead to a [VPN and was eventually used to identify him]( _URL_ also highly possible that _PERSON_ had other misconfigurations based on the one exposed by whyusheep.  An experienced webadmin would have disabled directory listing which suggests mdparity had little experience as a web server admin. This does not bode well for mpdarity or _PERSON_ because there are a ton of ways of misconfiguring a web server and some of these misconfigurations could have leaked more specific details.^1 I don't believe whyusheep reported anyone to LE or steal from _PERSON_.  I think that hackers or LE were monitoring this sub and saw the vulnerabilities who exposed and then abused them.  He exposed a very bad XSS vulnerability for Utopia.  It was found in message titles so no interaction was necessary to carry out the _PERSON_ theory------This could have been abused by LE to obtain the admins session cookie then      upload and execute some malicious script to get shell and ping home; I doubt the       admins configured their stack correctly and disabled IMCP all together.\--------end theory-------------------For _PERSON_, I believe he dosed them.  He also exposed the fact that the script (and possibly _PERSON_) was using floats to represent balances.

3d4gy4,42155,SharpShootersSecDen,1436793591,Keeping your credentials safe,"This post is geared towards darknet markets since there are many markets its likely people use multiple markets. It's likely people re-use account credentials across multiple services. I'd like to warn you this is not a safe practice. One should be using different login and passwords for every site. Moreover, they should be using strong randomly generated passwords. The reason for this is that if a site is compromised or you are phised then the adversary can access all your accounts. In addition to market hacks and phising not all sites have preventative measures against brute force attacks so an adversary can gain your credentials there as well. Now how does one manage different accounts with strong passwords for multiple accounts?  There are multiple solutions. The easiest is a piece of software called [keeppassx]( _URL_ This is a local client that stores ones credentials in an encrypted _PERSON_. Some other solutions include maintaining a flat file with user pass pairs and then encrypt this file using pgp (asymmetric algorithm) or openssl (preferably using aes, which is a symmetric encryption algorithm. The differences between asymmetric and symmetric encryption is that asymmetric algorithms use a key pair (public private) for encryption whereas symmetric algorithms use a single key (a password; preferably a strong one). One could be clever when using openssl and enable base64 encoding. They can then post this to a site like pastebin or similar sites and have it privately listed. This means one does not have to keep a copy of the file on their PC very long. For Linux users you can generate a randomly secure password using the following command in shell.     tr -dc '[:print:] &lt; /dev/urandom | head -c 12;echoThe 12 can be replaced with any amount of numbers and that number determines the number of characters."
3d4q39,42155,SharpShootersSecDen,1436798443,Secure your routers,"The brilliant researcher _PERSON_ has recently [reported a string of routers]( _URL_ being compromised and used for a botnet. The author mentions one particular router, Ubiquiti AirOS routers is being targeted, but most consumer routers have their admin interfaces exposed to the internet. What makes this worse is that consumer routers usually have default admin credentials and people do not change these. This allows script kiddies to brute force access and if they successfully gain access they can do nasty things like change the default DNS. This could be used to launch a ddos attack or the malicious actor could modify application updates to include malware. I'm making this post to encourage people to change their credentials for their routers so they do not become a victim of having their router hijacked and used for malicious purposes."
3d62kb,42155,SharpShootersSecDen,1436819236,Google research into security questions,"I found [this article from Google]( _URL_ to be very interesting.

Many websites rely on knowledge based questions. However, with the advent of social networking people are posting more information online many people will post the answers to some of the popular questions. Moreover, there are other sites like spokeo and other people searching sites that expose peoples personal information to anyone willing to pay. Perhaps its time to combine knowledge based questions with a token or some other form of 2fa (biometrics).  Though I can see this causing people to get permanently locked out of their accounts. Which would be problematic. I guess it comes down to consequences of being locked out permanently and comparing it to the risk of a hostile person taking over the account."

This hour, we go after a series of seemingly simple facts -- facts that offer surprising insight, facts that inspire deeply different stories, and facts that, in the end, might not matter at all."" Here's the full podcast, I highly recommend it (and all of radiolab's stuff for that matter _URL_ So there's this segment about the Hmong genocide and a question of whether or not an unknown chemical weapon nicknamed ""yellow rain"" was actually being used. There were many first person accounts but oddly NO physical evidence as to whether it was or not.So one of the hosts brings this lady and her uncle on, and they kind of go through the same points that were being brought up before, but they don't offer any new evidence, just a rather powerful first had account of what happened. So the host pushes for them to offer something else because it's still just complete conjecture until his niece (the person who wrote this article) completely lashes out. She basically uses the tragedy of the Hmong genocide as a basis to push her opinions as fact and get's really mad when _PERSON_ calls her on it and proceeds to write this article.So in response to the accusation of her using a tragedy to monopolize the interview...She uses the death of her newborn child to try to monopolize the further discussion and accuses radio lab of racism and sexism for some reason. SRS agrees. TL;DR ""Bad things happen to me and my ancestors therefore I'm right. Looking for evidence is racist and sexist."""

Aliens form up to make a UN like coalition in that universe and humanity, while opposed to that, realizes that it can't just rely on it's military might anymore and needs to start forging alliances.

161w3t,4790,Songwriting,1357457899,I can't get started with my songwriting,"I've been playing guitar for about 4 years now, and I've always wanted to start writing my own songs and riffs. The main problem I have is with my ideas. I'll only ever think of an idea once every few days or weeks or so. I'm a pretty negative person (a trait that I don't particularly like about myself) so usually I think the idea isn't good and it's left as one for the archives.Also, the riffs or licks or whatever you desire to call them, are very basic. They almost always use a major, minor or minor pentatonic scale. To me they sound OK but I know I have to expand if I want to create an original idea. They also don't seem to fit into any particular genre of music. I would like to make ideas in a genre with music like _PERSON_, but I repeatedly been thinking of melodies that sound like Blink-182. Don't get me wrong, I love Blink-182, but I don't want pop-punk style riffs.I understand if I seem understandable (contradictory, right?), but I was wondering if anyone can give me any good tips for getting started and also expanding my repertoire to reach out further when being creative."

I know it's my fault, as I dread having to study more and more nowadays, and I deliberately put off revision because I'm a lazy piece of shit. I recently got 3/15 for an English task, purely because I hate English with a burning passion and it's the only compulsory subject in school, and my parents found out and are trying to get me help but I don't want it. I feel too lazy too even improve myself.As well as this, next year I have to undergo the HSC (the big exam in Year 12 to end my time in high school) and that is putting me off even more. I have friends in Year 12 who are preparing for it right now and they told me that they have 10 essays to do in the space of a few days. Hearing this made me freak out, knowing that I'll have to push myself to do that much work this time next year.The main thing about this is that school is making me feel suicidal. Not the social aspect of it, because that is going well for me at the moment. Just all the workload. I don't want to have to spend all my time studying for my subjects. I like everything I do besides English, and my parents have forced me into Advanced English, which I constantly tell them but they never listen. I feel like killing myself before my life gets too busy and I never have enough time for anything. Also, if I don't do well in the HSC next year, it can prevent me from getting a good university degree, and then that ends up with me having no job, and having no money. My worst fear is the fear of not being to support myself in the future, all because I'm a lazy shit.I haven't planned ending it, but the thought of next year makes me want to.TL;DR: School work (especially the English subject) and future life makes me think of killing myself."

I'm about to start my last year of high school in Australia (Year 12) and after my poor results in Year 11, I REALLY NEED an attitude/habit change.To clarify, I've already started my Year 12 course, as everyone else has as well. I kept saying to myself ""Ok you will actually try hard and do well this time"", but already I'm being my old lazy self, procrastinating every time. Sure, I go out and I exercise, so at least I'm not totally inactive, but I just can't stand school. I don't care if I HAVE to do it, that won't make me give in any more than before.Someone help. I don't want to end up fucking it all up."

32bz66,4790,offmychest,1428847381,I just found my friend's plan for his funeral.,"I was taking some photos on my mates phone and I looked at his notes (I know, bad move) and apart from seeing everyday things such as shopping lists and such, I came across something that read ""My funeral/death."" Concerned by that, I had a look. He had an extremely long note detailing a suicide note he wanted to be read, who he wanted to read the eulogies and the memories he shared with his friends. And amongst all of this, I was mentioned nowhere.I've thought for years that he wasn't always feeling 100%, but whenever I tried to talk to him, he wouldn't give me answers. I don't like to be a hassle, so I backed off. And now I know the truth. He's just never wanted to be open about it, which I can understand.Now I said earlier that I wasn't mentioned in this note at all. That really hits me hard. All these past years, I've regarded this guy as my best mate. We grew up together. When I moved schools, he moved schools too. Our families have never had any arguments. I thought he regarded me as his best mate. And now I know that it's simply not true. And not even that. I'm not even regarded as close enough of a friend to him. That really pains me.This kid has brought so much joy into the lives of his friends and my friends. I have no idea what to do. I can't say anything to him, because then he'll know I read the notes. I don't feel close enough to him anymore, yet I still see him often.Last point. One reason for his choice is grief. Last year, one of the boys in my grade, who was a dear friend to everyone, committed suicide. In my friends note, he claimed that the grief caused by this friends death has affected him so much that he doesn't feel he can carry on. It was hard enough having to deal with this guys death. I don't want to have to attend another funeral for a friend.Reddit, what can I do? It's like I'm trying to tell him to stop, but my mouth has been stitched shut."

For years ive had severe depression and suicidal tendencies, I wont go into detail but I'm still fighting. Ive worked it out though, i cannot keep my own emotions in check so i cannot do it with other peoples, over the years i learnt how to handle problems, but now i can do it better. I will listen and distance myself, i won't feel your pain, ill help you but I'm not carrying your weight. I know how to fake a face and i know what my friends need, now i can do it without crippling my already shattered head further"

333qla,20797,nosleep,1429423180,Why I Don't Trust the Dark,"I woke up at night, hearing a sound that I couldn't define. This was odd, because I always had a fan on at night, and this would usually drown out any noise that was outside. I didn't have any pets at all, and nobody lived with me, so the sound couldn't have been from inside the house. I hoped.I tried to look at my alarm clock, but it was off, even though it was plugged in and switched on. The generator was probably blown, my house shared it with ten others.I shuffled out of my room to get a flashlight so I could find the source of the sound. The darkness shrouded me, and I had to feel the wall to get to the drawer. Eventually, the wall dropped away, and instead I felt my refrigerator's smooth, cold door. I opened the door, wondering why it was cold, and inside, the light was on. Everything was frozen. ""Wait, if my alarm was off, then why is this on?"" I muttered to myself.I decided to use the flashlight to go to my bedroom and see if any thing was wrong with the wiring. I got the flashlight out of the drawer and turned it on. I walked back to my room and opened the socket cover that my alarm was plugged into.The wires were cut. Not by animal teeth, the cut was too even.I heard footsteps coming from the kitchen. Someone else was in my house.I attempted to go into my garage and get my baseball bat that I had in case of someone breaking in at night. Mistake number one.My garage door was on the other side of the house than the kitchen, and about ten feet from where I was, so I had enough time to at least get there. I didn't ready myself, as the footsteps were getting too close. I flung the door open, and bolted into my garage. I grabbed the bat and ran into the house, bat over my head. Mistake number two.The last mistake I made was just seconds after mistake two. After I ran inside, the one who broke into my house was already just next to the door that lead to my garage. He grabbed me, and threw me out of the window that led to my backyard. I broke through my wooden fence with tremendous speed. I heard a door open and then grass crumpling as somebody ran over to me, and the last thing I remember of that night was my neighbor bending down to see if I was okay.I awoke in a bed that wasn't my own. I got out of it to see where I was, and saw a room with stone walls and a door with a window in it. I heard a voice over an intercom that was on top of the ceiling. It told me I was in a police station and was brought there because I flew through a fence to the backyard of my neighbor, and the neighbor called the police. The police found me with many scratches from flying through the fence, but the fence was wooden, and no damage was so bad that I needed to go to the hospital. I was also told I was going to get a pen and paper to describe what happened.Ten minutes later, a policeman, holding pen and paper, came through the door. He told me that when I was done writing, I was to open the door, turn the paper in at the front desk, then find a chair to sit in and wait for someone to come in and drive me home.But, when I got up to open the door and turn the paper in, I froze again.Outside the door window was the same silhouette I saw that night. I saw the door fling open, and felt being grabbed and thrown again, before landing on my head, knocking me out.I woke up this time in my house. I realized it was a dream of me being assaulted, and this was ridiculous, because I'm the one who assaults, and never the victim."

34psqs,20797,nosleep,1430660769,The,"About a year ago I went to a local Wal-Mart, and while going through the aisles I saw something on the floor. It looked like a phone (a _PERSON_ or iPhone). Picking it up I found it was a black _PERSON_ phone. I thought about taking it but my conscience got the best of me and I brought it to customer service. _PERSON_ (my friend who works there) said they would hold on to the phone for about a month, and after a month I would be able to keep the phone.About a month later I went to see _PERSON_ and he said the phone was taken a few days ago. I was a bit disappointed but relieved that that person had gotten their phone back. Going through the store doing the normal shopping I saw on the ground... another phone. Picking up the black phone, I saw it was the same exact _PERSON_ from about a month ago.So I decided to take the phone to customer service again, and _PERSON_ told me the same thing, ""If someone doesn't come to get it within a month, it's yours.""So after another month I came back and _PERSON_ told me the guy had taken the phone back, however he warned him that the next time someone found that phone, he would not give him another chance to get it back. So I did my usual shopping again and then, on one of the shelves I saw a black _PERSON_.Not just a black droid, the black droid from last month. I remembered what _PERSON_ said about keeping the phone. So I slid it into my pocket, hoping no people were watching, just in case they thought I was stealing from the store, and continued my shopping.When I got home I looked at the phone, and when I turned it on, I found it strange how it didn't have a code to get into it, seeing as how this man loses it often, but I brushed it off and investigated further. Through looking around I found nothing strange... at first. I went and looked at the pictures and saw some pictures of children running around and playing, they looked like they were having fun.I thought they were his kids, because he had so many pictures of them. However, once I got to maybe the seventh or eighth picture the kids seemed to get more sad and even a bit nervous or scared. Around the eleventh picture the kids were inside a room, each of the three or four kids were in the room separately. Then the images were just of more kids, again running, skipping and playing, all ending inside the room, all different, all going through the same process. I saw this sequence go on maybe three or four more times with multiple children each image. Then I decided to check the videos, how foolish that was.When I checked the videos I was sickened, the video took place in that strange room. However now it was darker, but just enough light so you could see. There was a small girl who couldn't be older than ten. You could hear her asking where her mom and dad were, but she got no response. The phone was placed behind the chair so you could see her back.Then a man in a gray hoodie came into the shot with a rope, and he tied the girls hands together then to the chair. After that the phone was picked up again and moved to her front, you could see her writhing from the pain of the tight ropes.""What the fuck?"" I said to myself as I watched her continually ask what was happening.Then after about thirty seconds the man moved his hand into the shot and started removing the young girls skirt. I gasped and paused the video. I felt nauseous. However, no matter how much I wanted to destroy the phone, I knew this was what I had to watch. Perhaps this man is a well-known pedophile who kidnaps children. I needed proof before I could hand this into the cops.So I skipped to about five minutes into the video. He was doing things that I shouldn't mention. All I heard was the young girl shouting ""NO!"" and ""PLEASE STOP"" and ""WHERE'S MOMMY?"", but she received no answer. I lost it all when I saw her starting to cry. I had to skip ahead. Another foolish mistake.The next scene I saw was no better. The girl had her skirt lying next to the chair, a white fluid was flowing off of her shirt (which was unbuttoned but not taken off) and chest, which I had assumed was from the man, and the girl had her head down, as if she had been ashamed.Then she picked her head up and said in a weak voice, ""Can I go home now?""I felt so bad for the young girl, for I knew she was hurting. The man still never spoke, not once. I was just looking at the young girl for a while until the man put the phone down in front of the girl. Then I saw the man on screen again however with something in his hands. It was a large-bladed knife. The man walked behind the girl, who was trying to break her tight bonds but to no success.The man took the knife and poked the tip into her neck, but didn't thrust. The knife, just barely pushing against the skin, the man moved his head down to her ear and whispered something. The girls eyes widened and she started trying to escape, but the man grabbed her by her hair and took the knife and sliced it across her neck. The sight of her blood splattering across the room stunned me.The man then moved to the front of her and pushed the knife against her chest and tore the skin down to her waist. Opening up her insides like dissecting a frog. He had started taking out some organs and I was forced to stop the video. I felt sick. I needed to see just one more video this bastard made.The next video was of a boy, around the age of five. I couldn't imagine what he could do to him. I watched for a bit but the man didn't go into the frame. The boy just sat there in the chair, not even his hands tied behind him. Then the boy got up and walked off screen. Soon after the phone was turned around to reveal an iron maiden with the boy standing beside it. The man moved the boy into the chamber and with no struggle the boy walked in. The man closed the large door and left.I watched for about ten seconds then decided to skip about five minutes. The door to the iron maiden was opened and blood dripped off of the spikes. After a few seconds the camera turned to a dead boy lying on the floor. Stomach torn open and internal organs spilling out. The sight of the boy almost made me throw up. I ended the video and went to the last one. This video was in the same room, and the phone was pointed at some statues, however the statues looked like children, and then I realized, they were the kids in the photos. The children in the videos, all died and were preserved and turned into statues.As i watched for the few minutes of nothing but staring at these stuffed children, I thought, who was this that did all this. How is he capable of doing this. So I turned the phone off and took it to the cops. When I showed the cops the phone they thought I was insane. I explained it all to them, but when they checked the phone they told me they found nothing of what I described. I checked the pictures, no pictures. I looked for videos, no videos. I was baffled. To think all of this information, lost.I found nothing, but I knew I saw the videos. I saw that boy put into the iron maiden, I watched that small girl get raped by that man. Now, nothing left, no evidence. I walked home thinking about how the videos could have been lost. That night I slept uncomfortable, rolling and thinking.The next morning I went to Wal-Mart and asked who the man was that took the phone. Because alongside the videos, all owner information had been lost. _PERSON_ had told me that he hadn't seen his face because he wore a gray hoodie and he never really told them his name. He only told about the phone.So I gave up. I walked out of customer service and placed the phone on a bench. When I got to the exit I looked behind me and saw a man pick up the phone and take it to customer service. Then, a man wearing a gray hoodie bumped into me and turned toward me. He just looked at me. Though I couldn't see anything above his nose, I saw he had some stubble, almost forming a low cut beard. Then he gave me a short grin and a chuckle. He said in a deep raspy voice.""Sorry, I didn't see you."" He then walked away and went into customer service.Well, here I am on reddit. Decided to tell you guys about my creepy experience.  What do you guys think?UPDATE 1: I decided to track this guy down, and follow him. I'll keep you posted. [4/5/15]UPDATE 2: Ok, so I saw the guy again in customer service, I decided to tail him, obviously I did this when I was off work. I followed him from a distance. He didn't do anything out of the ordinary.. He crossed the road. Then a large truck drove past, and he is gone?! I looked around, even on the side of the truck. Nothing. However their was a small note on the floor. It had a series of numbers.. Like co-ordinates. Infact they were..30.963853, -98.119898... I went home and checked the co-ordinates on the computer.. they led me to a lake in Texas?! I'll have to check that lake out IRL.. I'll keep you posted reddit. [6/5/15]Ok.. so i'm in Texas.. flight cost me $$294.00. Hope it was worth it. I'll keep you posted. [11/5/15]"
34q03c,20797,nosleep,1430665443,It's four AM and I can't get to sleep.,"Ok, so here is the story so far..I recently moved into a small 2 story house, It has a bathroom, a bedroom, a living room, kitchen..study, you know.. usual stuff. But the creepy thing is, the back of the house is facing a grave-yard 1700s.. I was cleaning out some dead grass and weeds in the back yard the otherday, and decided to hop over the old stone wall blocking my yard from the graveyard. I was curious. I soon noticed a old gravestone, corroded by natural rain and stuff. It was covered in crusty bird shit and moss. The gravestone read ""NORMAN WOODS 1702-1723"" and his grave. Their was a massive fucking hole in it, like a fox hole. I looked down into it. I saw the top of his casket, and a few cobwebs with large spiders relaxing in them. No sign of any foxes. Not to mention, the grave-yard was a mess, covered in weeds, looks like it was last cut in 2002. Local council must not see this as a urgent job, but whatever. I took some of my weed trimmings from my yard, and filled the hole with them. I was climbing back over the wall into my yard, when I swear to fucking god I heard someone groan right behind me. I spun the fuck round as fast as I could, my heart was racing.  Nothing there. So I just climbed back over into my yard, and walked inside, catching my breath. I then watched TV for a few hours, before I began to walk upstairs, turning the lights off, locking the doors, ect... I was at the top of the stairs, when I swear I heard the downstairs door to the living room creek open. I looked down and checked, it HAD moved open about 4 inches. I am scared shitless by this point. I crawl into bed, and pull the covers up to my neck. Closing my eyes. Darkness. Then, out of nowhere, a motherfucking cold ass breeze blows over-me, and A loud 'BANG' From outside, I jump up out of bed, rush downstairs, and turn on ALL the fucking lights, and fire up my laptop. Please. I'm scared shitless reddit. I'll keep you informed.[UPDATE 1] It's the next day and, I feel asleep on my desk. I replied to your comments, thank you all. I went outside this morning and saw that the grave was covered in weird tiny scratch marks, by this point i'm getting really freaked out. ""Leave me alone"" I said to the grave.. I went back into my living room, and saw that my front window, overlooking the main road, and a streetlight was fogged up. I went into the kitchen to get a rag to wipe off the moisture, but when I walked back into the room I froze. ""NO"" was written in big ass letters on the fogged glass. I dropped all my shit and updated it on Reddit. Here I am."

I get a lot of compliments on my skill and the overall sound of my playing. The thing is I don't feel that I am anywhere near where I want to be, talent wise. So you can understand the music I play it falls in the pop-punk sound (blink-182, green day, new found glory, etc.)I love playing the music from my favorite bands but the songs I play don't always have fantastic lead guitar. That is a huge problem especially now that I am starting a band. I don't want to try to be the next _PERSON_ or _PERSON_ but I really want to get good at playing the lead guitar and playing it up to tempo. I just need some ideas that could help me develop good playing styles so I can shred on my guitar. Is there any things that could purchase to help? I have been told to use a metronome, I never really thought of getting one.Tl;dr I am a pretty decent guitarist and I want to become a great lead guitarist for the band that I'm starting."

Now the thing that struck me as odd is, why did this never happen to _PERSON_ with _PERSON_? Why didn't he come back as a ghost in the story and try to talk some sense into _PERSON_? I feel like he could have made a huge difference in turn of events. Just curious to see what the actual explanation may be and what some of your ideas on it are."
1n5rok,9534,sad,1380174160,It has been a while..,"Hey guys and gals. I just need to vent.So what has it been almost a year now? i thought i was fine, every one saw my happiness again. My life seemed to get better of course a few rough spots. Thats just high school though. Its almost over any way about to graduate i should be happy that im getting away from this hell whole, right? Im not though. I hate the fact that im almost done with my childhood. Im almost gonna be out on my own. I dont feel im ready for this next step into adulthood. who do i go to? Parents? No they seem to be busy dealing with this whole BS separation they keep talking about. JUST FUCKING LEAVE THEN MOM! IF YOU DONT LOVE HIM ANYMORE JUST FUCKING GO! STOP TELLING ME ABOUT YOUR NEW ""GUYS"". you really think i want to hear about it? really? i want to hear about your affairs, really? FUCK NO, FUCK YOU for thinking thats okay. my step-Dad might be an ass but hes been there for me for almost 12 years now he took the spot of my dad when Damon got in an accident for drunk driving. Maybe thats what im gonna be and alcoholic, drug addict loser who cant take care of himself, let alone a wife and kid.My friends? No, im getting so sick of them. I dont know why. They were there after my break up. now they can barely keep themselves from fighting with each other about girls. Fucking stop! i subtweet all of you when i need help maybe thinking that ""Oh they saw and new i needed someone"" that doesnt happen. so i text them a long message about why im sorry im so pathetic. Its every other day. i dont remember the last time any of them even invited me to hang out. ""I dont know when you work"" Thats not an excuse text me at least if i dont text back then you know. Im probably sitting playing Injustice by myself anyways.The worst part is that out of everyone trying to help its my ex. She talks to me about everything and i hate it because i dont want her to know how much ive fallen apart since sophomore year. why is she helping me out? why her? We destroyed each other mentally and emotionally two years ago and now we both are trying to fix each other. Does she want me back? Maybe but it doesnt matter, that parts over. right? maybe i really want her back.As for my best friend whether it be _PERSON_ or _PERSON_. i dont know which one is because if i say one the other gets hurt. _PERSON_ 5 years man, 5 fucking years. Its all just falling apart because i feel like youd be better off without me and you dont do a damn thing to prove me wrong. I thought you and I were gonna be like _PERSON_ and _PERSON_. Brothers to the end. Is the end? i feel like if i moved schools you wouldnt notice a damn thing. _PERSON_ as for you thanks for trying so much to make me feel better. you probably are my best friend but the truth is were crazy for each other, or at least im crazy for you. I dont feel this way when im around you. i feel so happy. I dont care about the other problems. But you are killing me slowly with the fact your still with that piece of shit some call a person. We both know that you deserve better, i mean is it worth being with someone you fight with everyday. you said it yourself you know its not gonna last. stop beating a dead horse, just end it. Itll suck, but what happens everytime your sad i do everything to make you smile and what happens i make you smile. even for ten minutes i do. Maybe you just say those things to make me feel better about myself..Im sitting in my room giving this all to you guys on reddit, i dont know who to go to anymore. i just hurt the people i try to vent to because everyones a problem for me. Maybe im the problem.. it seems the most realistic. Maybe im just an asshole that doesnt value what good things i have. I hate this place called high school. I apologize for those of you reading this. I dont like going to people for my need of being a little bitch as call myself. I just need to grow up. its just hard without having people to help me out. Ive been writing really depressing lyrics lately and maybe i need to go to therapy again.. i dont know.Fellow redditors thanks for letting get this out. I know you guys probably dont care about some whiney 17 yr old boy but its nice to have a place like this for me to come to when i feel alone. sorry for the mad to sad type transition just a lot going through my head."

I was wrong on all of those.. Its me. Im whats wrong. ""If everyone is an asshole, then youre probably the asshole"". Those words make so much sense.Im an asshole, i shouldnt be here anymore. I was the one who sat with you day after day when your first girlfriend broke up with you. I was the one who gave you advice as to why you shouldnt keep talking to her. I was the one you would spend nights crying with when you were down. i was the one who slapped you around and made you feel better when she came into your mind. As for you, I was the one who would risk his job to go cheer up, i would buy you your favorite snack. Voltage mountain _PERSON_, Watermelon sour patch kids and _PERSON_. Hell i bought you plan B because your shit fuck of a boyfriend couldnt support you and when he found out you could be pregnant he acted like he cared.Every one of those sentences is about the people i call my ""Best Friends"". Who was there for me during my first heartbreak? No one. Who gave me advice when i needed it. No one. Who turned everything to being my fault. You all did.My parents fight and divorce is imminent. Im failing school now and it puts more stress on me than i already have. Now i have no friends to fall on for support oh wait i never did. Im letting everyone down. the only place i seem to matter is work and im easily replaceable there.So whats the point? Im 17 and it doesnt seem to be going anywhere. Everytime someone ""tries"" to help they just text me when they feel necessary. Just stop guys. Dont pretend to care, okay? Stop making me risk my neck for you when you all cant spend a fucking lunch break with me. You all just look at me and leave so i sit in my car.I cry at school everyday, everyfuckingday. All i feel is anger, hatred and sorrow. no matter what. Fuck you guys for making feel that way fuck everyone for making me feel that way.If i died tomorrow would you really notice? If i ended up in the hospital who would stay there until i was out? none of you. Maybe i should find out. Bottle of vodka in my freezer, down it, stand on my roof and hope for the best. The best being? i dont know.. broken bones and everyone checking up on me. If i can find my dads gun maybe itd be a nice experience to be shot.Im so angry, everytime i see someone smile i want to break their skull on the wall theyre next to. I want to physically hurt someone so much its unbearable.Im the asshole though, because im over sensitive because i give a fuck about you all. Next year youre all gone but sometimes i think you could all be gone right now. instead of this post calling out for help i could go up there and jump, i could slit my wrists till i bleed out, i even know how to tie a noose. so many possibilities..Maybe i deserve to spend my life suffering, im the asshole and i dont deserve to get out of this that quickly._PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, Jesse, Emmalee.. i cant do this much longer. i cant. im tired of feeling like this and no one has really been trying to help.. Maybe my best friend isnt you all but the bullet that puts me out of my misery. im sorry guys. im trying so hard for you all but im always just the asshole of the group that you guys seem to not care about anyways.Please.."

2c5nxd,9534,sad,1406740611,Back to feeling hollow again.,"It was almost a year since it all started again with us. You texted me on my birthday last year and it was the best present i could have asked for. You and i were friends for a month while i was dealing with problems i had with another girl who at one point was my best friend. Then Sept. 30 i claimed to you that i missed you and you confessed the same to me. Then for the first time in 2 years we kissed. I broke off everything with the other girl because i had wanted you back for so long. For two years i thought about you being mine again and it happened.We were so happy for months then everything started falling apart with my parents. My mom had been cheating on my dad with her boss and my dad fell into a slump. They both used me to talk because they had no where else to go. I hated it and you were there for me when i needed it. You loved me and it was just perfect. Weeks go by and then my dog died and i got off work came over and broke down in front of you and you held me like you'd never let go. I did everything i could to make you happy and i did for so long. I know you tried for me to but i was so off and on with my anti-depressants that it never seemed like it was helping when it reality i stopped taking them because being with you made me happy enough where i felt i could manage without them. 8 months go by and its the best time i have ever had and i felt like you were going to be the one. Then we started fighting more and more. About little things and always tried to apologize and stop but my fucking brain never would let me. You said you wanted more time for your friends and my argument was that i work so much that you have plenty of time to see them. You didn't want to plan your days around my schedule but when you had chances to see them you just watched netflix. I guess i was suffocating you towards the end and its because i didn't want you to leave again. I knew what would happen to us both. I would slump back into my depression and start wanting to self harm and i knew you would probably go back to how you were as well. Its starting again. Especially today, today was supposed to be 10 months with you. I can't get your face out of my head, i woke up crying at my friends house and left super early because i didn't want him to see me cry. I called you last night and told you if you took me back we'd find the spark again. You fell out of love with me and explained that were both 17 and we shouldn't have to be a relationship that fights so much. Yes i know were 17, but i do know that you were my best friend, the best girlfriend i could have asked for and that i love you more than anything else.I don't know if i can do it again. I'm about to go to college and i know theres plenty of girls but none of them are you. None of them smile, laugh, talk, think, care like you. They aren't you.Im so in love with you that it hurts because i know you still love me.I have one friend now and he's on the bubble of suicide and i'm pretty sure the only reason he hasn't killed himself is because of me. Everyone else left me alone to be sad and hollow. Neither of us had a lot of good friends but we had each other and honestly thats all i needed.So _PERSON_, if you ever see this and after the phone call please know i want you back and i know we can make everything back to normal. i know we can i have faith in us.Thank you guys for letting me get this off my chest."
2ecctv,9534,depression,1408769346,How do i love myself again?,"What is that thing i feel for you that you never really felt back? Love. I love you so much its finally starting to kill me. The thing is you don't want to believe it or just don't care enough to know how fucked up i am. My depression was the reason we broke up. I have always had abandonment issues ever since my dad left my mom when i was one. What ass hole does that? Drug addict ones that's who. I don't really know why he left but according to my mom thats not why. I never really fit in with anyone and to top it off my best friend is practically the opposite of me. But he wasn't always my best friend. No i finally realized he was the only real friend i had. I feel like he hasn't killed himself yet is because he doesn't want me to kill myself. What shit situation. My last best friend that wasn't a girlfriend was/is an asshole. Then again i seemed to be surrounded by a world of assholes. I cared too much for him. He hadn't talked to me in 6 months and finally decided to let me know he still care on my birthday. Really? No its cool man you don't have to lie, your girlfriend just broke up with you and i offer to help you because i know your pain(way worse) but still. He isn't the subject though. I am the subject. But to what tale? Where the young hero spends his childhood and teenage years suffering and ends up being everything he wanted to be when he's older if he makes it. Or simply the tale of some sad young adult whose best years were before puberty? Maybe i just make it all up, maybe its not as bad as i think. Maybe I'm just crazy. oh yeah i am.Thats why i push people away. Thats I'm never invited places. i sit there and think about the worst possible outcome for the situation. i over think things way too much. i can go from how i got a new dog all the way to how one day that dog will bring me pain from watching it in physical agony till we have to put it down. Speaking of which i never get to say good bye to my dog _PERSON_, they just took her while i was at work. I'm 18, just started college, single. i mean what else could i ask for? How about self esteem, or being very talented in the things i love doing, or being a little more attractive oh yeah and to have the person that made all my bottled emotions and time-bomb feelings finally break almost 4 weeks ago. I loved you and i had so much shit going on that i was so stressed about and i had one person that i could always rely on. The weight was too much for you. My parents split up, my dog died, i was dealing with a lot of physical pain from work and emotional pain from my family and to top it off i wasn't sure if i was gonna have the money for college. I was back to being on an emotional roller coaster. When i was with you though i had it all figured out and i could go on about my days. I felt like i had a home again with you and your family.But you're gone now and I'm left to pick up the fragments of myself that i lost loving you. i don't know how not to feel lost with out you. Now I'm sitting here in my house alone because my mom and her boyfriend are out. They say you have to love yourself before you can love anyone else but i don't see how i can. If i push someone away who was my only friend, girlfriend and person in my life that wasn't making me feel like i was a waste of space then how can i ever do that for myself. I mean i don't see anything great in myself. Everything i do to get my mind of things makes me even sadder. Food taste bland, Music is dull or sad, video games are hard to play by myself again. I'm a loser and i don't deserve anyone or anything good in my life. Nobody wants to be around a depressed person all day.How am i supposed to love myself again when everything i feel i do or try is absolute shit. How do i see value in myself? How do i care about myself the way i did back in elementary or middle school before i moved? How am i supposed feel good about me when the person who saw the good in me says they don't love me anymore? I see people who have it worse then i do, so i feel that I'm a selfish asshole for crying about my first love. How do i love myself again?"

I can barely hold a conversation with my best friend most of the time. I thought i was doing better. I quit my job and got a new one. Im dropping out of college because it brings me down being there. I have friends, or i think i have friends. I don't talk much to people and when i do even over text i don't know how to keep the conversation going. I don't know who to go to because i don't want my parents freaking out thinking im suicidal again. im not. I just feel so bummed out all the time. I hate this town but i dont have enough to move out. Days were easy about a month or two ago. I dont know when it stopped. I don't know when i started withdrawing into myself again. I want a girl to talk to that likes me. I dont want to be everyones second, third, fourth choice. My only real friend is talking to a girl so hes always distracted with her and im just there. Im sure if i left town tomorrow no one would really notice let alone care. I miss the days when i had friends and people to talk to. I miss everyone remembering me as the class clown rather than the downer that just faded away. I want to follow my passion of being an entertainer but i don't have all the resources i need and can never find the right people to help me. I dont want my dad to move to live with his GF but i want him to be happy. I dont want my mom to have the baby shes gonna have soon. I feel like i give more of myself to people and they just walk over it and even when i try being selfish, it just seems to backfire making me more of a lonely asshole. I joined a fraternity because my old friend dragged me to it and i dont miss it, i just feel like im letting down a group of people that ""care"". I dont fit in anywhere, and i havent in a long time. I havent been sad in a while but its coming back and its for reasons other than my ex, which scares me. I dont know how to get better from making myself hurt. I hurt myself, emotionally and i cant seem to fix it. Im crying, i havent cried in a while. Im tired of this place, im tired of this town, of my life, of this rut that im stuck in. I thought 18 was supposed to be fun. I thought everything was supposed to change when i got to college. I dont feel a connection to anyone anymore. Im tired of the liars, im tired of the word ""love"" im tired of waking up, im just so fucking tired of it all. Maybe i was just meant to live my life by myself, maybe my days of living in solitude dont start after retirement maybe they start now.Thank you guys for listening, ive been holding this in for a while now and didn't know where to go."

This weekend I found myself in a spot where i was researching methods.  I woke up yesterday with this in my head, realizing that without paying attention I seem to have come to a decision.  I went to the gym.  Maybe it was the endorphins or just time, but i decided i would try again, and now, a day later, I am wondering why.  Nothing is helping.  The drugs are bullshit.  The therapy isn't helping.  I cannot get myself to a point where i can get what i need out of life, and when i look at myself in the mirror I realize that this is something that's gonna happen eventually anyway.

This seems like it could  get to a point where I'm no longer safe on my own.Thing is, even though the hospital usually helps, it is a temporary help, and within a few weeks I'm right back where I started.  I'm at a loss.  There doesn't really seem like there's any thing I can do to get out of this.  Anyway, thanks for letting me vent."

She has about 200 items listed and still has  300 more items to photograph and get online.  The hours of time that it takes to get the job done are killing her. i have observed her workflow and it is as follows:place and light subject - photograph, rotate for next view, take another photo, etc for about 12 to 20 photos.. why so many? front, back, inside and outside as well as closeups of  materials and labels  are used on a lot of vintage designer clothing and handbags..Then she pulls the smart media card out of her 8 year old &lt;gasp!&gt;Olympus and puts it in a Sandisk reader,  writes the files out to the hard drive on her PC and then edits in Picasa - usually some cropping,  and occasional color correction.   The photos get added to her eBay  listing. Each item takes from 10 minutes to 30 minutes to do this way. The old smart media card died and a replacement 128MB card costs around 50-60$. Yep. I said 128MB, not GB.  I really don't want to re-invest in supporting such old tech, even though the camera is well built, has lasted a long time, and produces reasonably good photos.I tried getting her a Samsung WB150 with built in wi-fi to help simplify  the transfer task, but as it turns out the camera would not save my wireless security settings - every time it had to reconnect I had to re-enter the passphrase for WPA...  it made things worse, not better. So I returned that camera today. I am now skeptical that wifi will really help.. I am thinking that an always on usb connection might be best..

After I moved out I got slapped with a restraining order. After I showed the text messages to the judge at the hearing he laughed and threw it out. So if she tries to file against me again for whatever reason she can be hit with abuse of process (contempt) since she didn't even show up to the hearing to have the RO extended.So during that restraining order time I wasn't able to show the apartment and get myself off the lease, but now that it's over I have been signed off the lease thanks to a craigslist posting advertising the room for rent. Once I get the official documentation that I am officially off the lease the family lawyer said he would file all the paperwork to recoup money for unpaid utilities/rent. I dropped off all the payment stubs and breakdown of who paid what when and he said he would take care of everything.Sucks that it had to go this far.

I'm not, but I am to him and that is paramount.I broke up with the love of my life approximately a year ago.  She was not being considerate of our relationship and neither was I, so I ended it.  She is now across the country with my [former] best friend.  I know she still loves me.  The very brief conversations I've had with her confirm that.  I am currently with a fantastic girl who treats me unbelievably well and loves me a ton.  But I don't feel the same.  I don't know why, I just don't.  Maybe I'm still hung up on my ex.  Maybe I just can't commit to anything.  No idea.I think I am an alcoholic.  I drink every day, sometimes when I first wake up.  When I can get it/it is offered to me I will gladly put adderall up my nose/other uppers.  I do not smoke weed.  I have mild financial issues that are easily overcome with a job that I'm starting any day.  I feel that I may be wasting all of your time with this post because I think booze might be the significant problem here and if I just quit drinking everything will be fine.  But maybe not.  I don't know.I'm worried about myself.  I feel alienated, and there isn't anyone I feel particularly comfortable talking to about my personal issues.  Sometimes, when I'm alone and watching videos or movies or listening to music, I get lost in the endless stream of creativity I can't seem to tap into these days.  I'm an uninspired musician these days.I don't know if I'm suicidal.  I've thought about it a lot, more recently.  I feel very alone.  I want my friends to care about me more than they do.  I want attention.  I want to be ok.  I don't understand how there is so much misery and apathy in this country (the u.s.a.) and in the world in general.  I feel like I don't understand anything.  I love you all.  Specifically the folks on this subreddit, anyone who subscribes here and tries to help out when they can is a really great person and deserves more credit than they get."

1ohpn4,51666,relationship_advice,1381829131,"I suppose I am better off. But god damn, this hurts.","So I just broke up with my girlfriend (again) yesterday.  I'm going to try and condense this as much as possible, but like with any story, some details will be skipped.Early last year I went through a horrible breakup.  I became an alcoholic and completely squandered my last semester of college (I cannot for the life of me figure out how I graduated).  I was suicidal and wrote a note, but never did anything.  I talked to a therapist about it and those urges eventually went away.  I moved to New York immediately after graduation to try to escape but that didn't help - I kept drinking and not pursuing my interests and loves at all.  I was lost.  I found out that summer that my ex was dating my (former) best friend of 3-4 years.  Since then - I've moved back close to my former school, near a lot of old and new friends.  Wonderful kids who really feel like family these days.  I've made my peace with my ex.  I have some pretty fucking bad insecurity and trust issues because of what she and he did, but she has been through an incredibly rough time for a while (her Mom died, she is from one of those towns that recently had a massacre, her grandfather died, more) and all I want is for her to be happy.  We talk a lot.My newer (now ex) girlfriend I met a few months after I broke up with my ex ex.  She lived across the country.  We stayed in contact after initially hooking up, and I eventually went to visit her out there.  I got offered a job when I was out there and towards the end of last summer I moved out of New York to California.  I had been taking prescribed medications for undiagnosed symptoms for years, and wasn't really capable of putting real effort into anything.  I failed at the job, eventually quit, and moved back east.  During this time, the newer girlfriend and I became very close, and were very in love.  When I was getting ready to come back east, we started talking about her coming with me somehow.  When I got back, I moved into a room in an apartment with a best friend.  I found her a room in a house that some of my friends (her acquaintances at the time) were living in and fixing up.  Throughout all of this I was drinking too much, on and off.  Almost every day and to excess sometimes.  When summer started this year, I felt that she started distancing herself from me.  I quit drinking for long enough to kick the meds and was in the process of finding a great job and trying out new hobbies and generally improving myself as a person.  I started to worry that she would/had already cheated on me.  She was going out a lot, drinking a lot and wasn't enthusiastic about spending time with me really.  Two months ago I became very stressed out about finding a new apartment/roommate, losing my job because I was having trouble getting my driver's license and feeling like my friends weren't interested in doing anything other than sitting around drinking (which I was less interested in - I started playing basketball and biking a lot, doing things that normal people to do entertain themselves).  But I was handling it.  She continued to go out and seem not to care about me.  In early September I sat her down and asked what was going on.  She said that she didn't love me as much as she used to and didn't know why.  I was hurt, but still willing to put the effort into the relationship.  Which I did.  I asked her to spend time with me, do the kinds of things we used to enjoy and find common ground to get excited on.  She responded for a little while then started slipping away again.  I started feeling inadequate in the bedroom which became a vicious cycle of me asking her what I could do better, and her being turned off by my lack of confidence.  I started telling her on nights that she was going out and I wasn't to text me/call me just be in touch because I wasn't feeling great about how things were between us.  She kept failing at that, time and time again.  She went back home to _PERSON_ for a couple weeks and I felt like she didn't care about our relationship at all.  I got more and more upset, and more insecure.  When she got back and nothing was changing, eventually I laid down the law, said she had one more chance.  The next night she stayed out literally all night and never called or texted.  I broke up with her that morning.  We stayed broken up for about a week.  I was heartbroken.  I loved her so much, didn't think it was fair that we had just drifted apart like this.  Eventually we got together and talked - I told her I thought we should get back together and try again because if we were eventually going to break up, it should be because we weren't right for each other, not because of lack of communication.  I didn't want to just throw it away.  She agreed and it was great.A couple days ago, I had a horrible day at work (I work with behaviorally challenged teenagers, a rough day means me restraining children and calling the police and having things thrown at me) at just wanted to come home to my girlfriend who I love.  She said she needed to talk to me about something.  I said ok.She said that she was so happy we were back together and going to try again.  But she wanted to be honest with me.  She hadn't been faithful.  At a show in Boston she met a guy I've kind of known through one of my best friends (guy I lived with).  They stayed up late talking that night and according to her, didn't hook up.  But when she was in California in August, he drove up 3 hours from San Francisco and they hung out with all of her friends there and had sex from three days/three nights.  When she told me this the night before last I yelled at her for 45 minutes, trying to communicate how hurt I was, how much damage this will do to me, how I'm on the upswing after years of disappointment and depression and how I'm glad to be rid of her.  Needless to say we are broken up and I have no plans to get back together with her.But fuck me, I am in so much pain.  I don't know what to do.  She fucked him without a condom, I have to get tested now, I feel betrayed.  _PERSON_.  Unclean.  I can't stand the thought of sex or touching myself.  My friends are great, they all are on my side.  But this hurt is so fucking intense.  I can't keep my food down and I can't sleep.  I can't get the images of her with that fucking asshole out of my head.  I'm destroyed.  I'm not drinking, I'm not using drugs at all, I'm exercising and just trying to move on.  But I need help, guys.  What's some decent advice for me?  I can't do anything when I'm alone but just marvel at how fucked I am, and how this poisonous person snuck into my life, took advantage of my town and friends, stabbed me in the back and shattered my heart.  I just fucking cry and cry and cry and keep asking why she has done this to someone who loved her so much.  She even made me feel bad for ever suggesting I was worried she would cheat on me (which I didn't really start doing until months after she had met this prick).  She obviously is a terrible person.  I'm trying so hard to get my shit together and have been for a while, but I need some help with this fucking hurt.  It's not fair and I feel so fucking disgusting for ever believing her lies and bothering to love someone like that at all.  She's made a fool of me.  Please helpTL;DR  I gave a relationship my all, and she cheated on me and lied about it to me and all our friends.  No idea who she is now and I don't know what to do with all this pain."

355i4m,18401,TalesFromRetail,1430983938,Senile woman insists on purchasing our trash,"Long time lurker but I have a story I think fits in here. On mobile so sorry for formatting.This happened a few years ago when I worked at a chain craft store. It was ten minutes until closing, I had cleaned the register area and was ready to go home and watch _PERSON_. My manager started dimming the lights and getting ready to close. We thought the store was empty but suddenly I heard a faint creaking approaching the register. It was a little old lady with a cart FULL of stuff ready to check out.Most of our customers were older, so I've learned to be pretty patient with the elderly but this was just a whole other level. She had TRASH in her cart. Like, crinkled papers, candy wrappers, and broken pens from the dollar bin. She had found basically every possible item I would have had to damage-out. I informed her those items were trash which made her very upset because she insisted they were perfectly good and she wanted them. I told her she could have them, but they would be free....because they're trash. She was eternally grateful for this and could not understand that an old water-bottle some customer left behind wasn't a product we sold. So I start bagging her free trash and her odd assortment of products. She was going on and on about how her husband doesn't like her shopping habits and how he gets angry at how much money she spends. She stops talking and looks me dead in the eyes. She point to her face and says ""my husband didn't give me this black eye, I fell"". Then immediately resumes worrying about the trash in her cart and how I am organizing it in the bags. I kept looking at her during this time and she didn't have a black eye. It occurred to me that maybe that incident had occurred a long time ago and she had lost concept of time, repeating the excuse over and over.It took over an hour to check her out. She kept forgetting what she was doing. She would hand me an item to scan, take it back and tell me about why she liked it and how it would fit on her bookshelf, or how the color matched her favorite lamp, etc. Finally, it was time to pay and It took her probably 15 minutes to write the check. She started over with a new check twice because she spelled the stores name wrong and one more time because her hands were shaking so bad she insisted the ""register machine"" wouldn't be able to decipher it.  All this while she muttered about how happy she was a nice girl like me had given her all the nice products for free.I helped her out (expecting her husband to be waiting in the car) and I was horrified to see she had driven there herself.My manager gave me a pat on the back and told me I had the patience of a saint and he would have blown up on her to hurry up. But I wasn't angry about her taking up my time in the end; I just felt very sad and worried for her and I still wonder about her sometimes."
36z0pn,18401,tifu,1432372118,TIFU by letting my boyfriend get wasted for his birthday,"This literally JUST happened.My boyfriend turns 21 on Sunday and, since the bars will be lame and empty, I bought him some booze and offered to be his designated driver.I was stone sober all night long while him and our friends got hammered. He passed out in bed a few hours ago and I snuggled next to him surfing reddit on my phone, just generally making sure he was okay and breathing and whatnot.20 minutes ago he slumps over the bed, whips his cock out and PISSES alllll over his carpet. I'm yelling at him and hitting his back, but he just keeps on pissing a healthy manly-stream of beer-powered urine. By the time he has finished his pee rampage, he has absolutely soaked his guitar amps and pedals, printer, and other expensive-looking gadgets. He is still unresponsive to my yelling and passed out halfway on the bed. I tried to pull him back on but he is twice my size and can't be awakened!I wiped the pee off everything the best I could, but he hit a bundle of wires that is also connected to his computer and stereo system, so I am unsure of what the damage is. I had to take a shower afterwards and the room smells awful. I fear if I go to sleep, there may be a round 2 in which he mistakes me for the toilet.Now I'm sitting in bed wondering how I'm going to break the news to him in the morning that he pissed on/potentially ruined his nice things. I don't want to ever be the designated sober person again.UPDATE: I told him and he thought I was playing a prank on him. He believed me once he found a hidden reservoir of pee underneath his amp. He's very embarrassed and asked me not to tell anyone. Oops. It's our little secret, right reddit?"
37dn3r,18401,fatpeoplestories,1432675695,High school with Hamber: How a hammy ruined Prom,"I originally met _PERSON_ in third grade. _PERSON_ lived with her single mother who we will call _PERSON_ (because she was spherical like a wrecking ball and emotionally damaging). _PERSON_ was already overweight in the third grade. _PERSON_ would pack her lunch with 3 packets of fruit roll ups, gogurt, and a can of diet coke...every. Single. Day. Poor _PERSON_ was doomed from the start.Flash forward to 10th grade high school. _PERSON_ and I began talking again. She was always on the chubby side, but years of fruit roll ups caught up with her - _PERSON_ was easily 250 pounds at 5'4"", but this didn't bother me because she was my friend. _PERSON_ and I did everything together. We would go home after school and watch TV. _PERSON_ would hold a box of cereal up to her mouth and poor the contents into her mouth until she finished the entire box. She said she didn't like milk and there was no point in using a bowl (which I guess is true if you plan on eating 12 servings in one sitting).Occasionally _PERSON_ would poke her ugly balding head out of her filthy bedroom hoarded with tupperware, and scream at _PERSON_ to get her daily exercise with 10 minutes on the elliptical machine. _PERSON_, bless her soul, would do the entire ten minutes of exercise with a chocolate bar in her hands. One Christmas, _PERSON_ gave _PERSON_ one of those gigantic novelty 5 lb Hershey bars. _PERSON_ ate the entire thing in 24 hours while watching a COPS marathon.Anyway, in high school we were best buddies. But _PERSON_ began acting strange. She suddenly began not talking to me as much and I noticed her friends also ignored me. She seemed to snap at nothing and would yell at me. I was going through things at home, and was convinced it was normal for people to treat me this way.In 11th grade _PERSON_ became obsessed with her ""curves"". She told me the boys wouldn't want to date me because my body looked like a little boys, that I had no boobs, no ass. It went further as she told me my neck was too long, my legs were too short, my arms were too long. And I began to believe her. I became very depressed. I was put on an anti-depressant that happened to kill my appetite and I lost weight.As I lost weight, _PERSON_ exponentially gained it. She would eat the food I couldn't finish. One time she called in an order to _PERSON_, said it was for a party, and ate the entire order in her car so nobody would see and judge her. _PERSON_ didn't hang out with me on my birthday because she made plans with her other friends to go to McDonalds. She was 300lbs by then.I was shy and self-conscious BUT I met a guy I really liked (_PERSON_ or CD) in Algebra class! He was nice to me. _PERSON_ was approaching and I was ecstatic! Would he ask _PERSON_ told _PERSON_ all about him! How exciting! She agreed he was super hot and expressed her happiness for me.A few days before prom, CD would no longer make eye contact with me in class. He ignored me whenever I said hi in the halls. I was hurt that he wouldn't talk to me and I didn't understand what I did wrong. _PERSON_ said he seemed like the kind of guy that appreciated ""a woman with meat"" and that must be why. I cried so hard when I had to stay home because not only did CD not ask me to prom, _PERSON_ also went to prom with her other friends and did not invite me.Flash forward again. I reconnected with some people on facebook, including CD. We got to reminiscing and the subject of _PERSON_ was brought up. He said he was going to ask me, but was too scared and naive, and didn't want to be responsible for helping me.""...What are you talking about?"" I asked.Turns out _PERSON_ approached CD one day and told him I had an eating disorder and that he shouldn't get involved with me because i was helpless and would die soon.Yep. _PERSON_ lied about me having an eating disorder because she couldn't bear the thought of me being happy for one night.

See my previous story for more background!On this particular day, _PERSON_ and I were at her house after school, doing homework. I stood up to get a glass of water. Mama _PERSON_ entered the kitchen behind _PERSON_, you have NOO ASSS"",Mama _PERSON_ roared.I will never forget the pure confusion and hurt that I felt. Why a mother found it appropriate to say that to her daughters friend, I will never know.I retorted with the honest fact, ""haha, yeah these pants fit terribly on me.""(They did. Those pants sucked)She said ""NO, Purple_mittens, you just have NOOO ASS!!!""I had no clue what to say to this! I started to tear up. I was 17 and already body conscious enough, and the fat logic that _PERSON_ spewed at me didn't help. I eventually replied ""well, what am I supposed to do about it??"" Mama _PERSON_ bellowed ""EAT."" and went to the toaster. But she didn't just go to the toaster, she brought the new bag of bagels with her. She proceeded to toast the 6 bagels and told me ""you need to eat some carbs NOW."" I ate one and went back to work. But she interrupted ""No! Eat ALL OF THEM.""Dumbfounded, I replied ""I can't eat al that!""""Well you're not going anywhere until you do, missy!!!"", Mama _PERSON_ barked. ""You look like a sickly corpse! This is because I care about you! I can't have you dying in my house!!!""I was stuffed to capacity by bagel 2. Nauseous at bagel 3. I kept hoping it was some weird crazy inside family prank but she just sat and stared daggers at me as I ate bagel #4.I physically could not eat that much, and I ran to the bathroom and puked. I heard hushed conversation in the kitchen between _PERSON_ and Mama _PERSON_ talking about my BULIMIA and how this was all a ploy for attention. They honestly believed all of their actions were sane, and I was the one who had the weight issue.When I returned from the bathroom, _PERSON_ and Mama _PERSON_ were munching away on the bagels I couldn't finish, I guess because they needed a snack from all that hard concern.That's pretty much the end of this tale. I will post more as I remember them (I promise most of them are hilarious and less about their ham abuse)"

I always just assumed it was something she couldn't help (sometimes my hair gets greasy and gross in the day- especially when it's hot).Well, let me tell you! One fateful summer, _PERSON_ and I hung out a lot, but it was always at her house and always watching TV. I would go and do my own things, come back, and she would be in the same place, in her pajamas eating cereal.One day I came over and found her picking/ scraping her arms and legs with her fingernails.I asked her what she was doing and was horrified.""Sometimes I don't shower for a week or so, because I like being able to scrape off the layers of goo.""She said it like it was a completely normal thing to do. _PERSON_ (wearing a ""topper""- one of those half wigs to cover up female balding on the top of her head) heard the conversation from her bedroom and bellowed ""HAMBER GO TAKE A DAMN SHOWER""_PERSON_ sighed and went into the bathroom. I heard the shower run.""THANK GOD, HAMBER WAS STARTIN TO STINK UP THE _PERSON_"", _PERSON_ yelled from her filthy smelly hoarded bedroom of tupperware, trash, and old food._PERSON_ came back out, but she was completely dry. I asked her what was up, and she told me she faked a shower. She said her mother wouldn't notice anyway, and she wanted to continue to pick the filth off of her skin.The end."

I only watch him because I love him. I love the little things about him, like how the lines around his eyes have matured since January, or the way his hair seems to grow faster in the winter, and blonder in the summer.Sometimes I get angry, because he wastes so much time drinking and sleeping with cheap sluts. So much valuable time he could be dedicating to us.He needs to appreciate me by tonight, or else something very, very bad will happen to him.I'm waiting in his apartment. 11:57pm. He comes home from the bar and passes out on the floor. Doesn't he know drinking can kill? Why would he rather die than be with me?11:58pm. I want to strike him, force him to finally acknowledge how much he needs _PERSON_. He needs to look me in the face, and realize everything he has to live for, his future.12:00am. I cry to him 12 times, but he only drunkenly fumbles to stop my swinging pendulum. I slowly stop ticking, I cease to exist to him. His time is up.He falls backwards, out cold. I only watch a few more seconds as he exhales his final breath and leaves in a puff of disintegrated black air.I'm heartbroken but there's so many other people to watch, like you.Don't waste me. Appreciate and love me. Make good use of your time."

When we joined the gym at first, we agreed to go 3 times a week to do an hour of elliptical/treadmill before heading in to the hour-long yoga class. The hour of exercise quickly proved to be too much for _PERSON_. She would complain about anything to get out of exercising.I remember a particular time where that song by the Romantics ""what I like about you"" came on the radio and she freaked out.""I HATE THIS SONG THIS SUCKS I CANT EXERCISE TO THIS SONG"", she screamed. A woman on a nearby treadmill gave me a sympathetic look, as _PERSON_ plopped herself down on an exercise bench with her arms crossed and moped the entire rest of the time I worked out.It turned into me walking on a treadmill alone for an hour while _PERSON_ would wait in the locker room and eat potato chips. She thought it was hilarious and ironic to eat in there.Yoga started out great and I loved it, but _PERSON_ wouldn't even attempt some of the positions. She would say ""I can't do that"" and then just lie on her back on the mat and stare at the ceiling while the rest of us did our downward dogs. It was awkward and embarrassing.After our visit to the gym, _PERSON_ would pick us up in her Volvo full of trash and fruit flies. Every time I got in that car I had to push over a growing mound of trash and sit on a seat covered in gravel and bits of grass (don't know how that happened). _PERSON_ would stick her mail and other papers over the area with the odometer and gas-gauge, so she never had any idea how fast she was going or how much gas she had. If you ever pointed out to her how unsafe it was to drive without knowing your speed, she would get extremely defensive and bark ""I JUST GO WITH THE FLOW"". _PERSON_ was so so so proud of her baby _PERSON_ and I for taking care of our bodies that she wanted to reward us. So after every gym visit, she would drive us to _PERSON_ and get us ice cream. _PERSON_ always got a chocolate covered cone with 2 scoops and would devour it. _PERSON_ would coo and proclaim how hungry and exhausted her little _PERSON_ must be after her hard 2-hour workout. This went on only for a few weeks before _PERSON_ decided the gym wasn't right for us because _PERSON_ was acting very tired all the time and she must be exerting herself too hard.RIP gym membership.EDIT: ""What I like about you"" is not by the _PERSON_."

I've tried to fatten him up but he fights me every step of the way, refusing to drink his new formula and seemingly metabolizing things faster than I can microwave a bottle. Nobody wants to pinch my skinny baby and play peekaboo. People walk right by and act like he doesn't exist.Sometimes I feel like he doesn't gain weight on purpose, just to rob me of my gleaming years of motherhood. I know that's crazy, and then I feel guilty and cry because all I want is for my baby to be healthy.My husband says I have post-partum depression. But he's even worse. He locks himself in the bedroom and never comes anywhere with me and the baby. He looks at me differently, and I worry that he no longer finds my body attractive.Yesterday at the grocery store, someone called the police because they think I'm starving my baby. I keep telling the investigators that I'm doing everything I can to fatten him up but they won't listen. That's why I'm writing this statement for my lawyer. When he gets me out of here and gets me my baby back, I want to sue this department for slander. Not only do they say I don't deserve my baby, they call me ""pathetic"" and ""mentally ill"".

A quick google search landed me in a forum of people discussing their experiences. They claimed that, after gluing their mirrors back together, a strange phenomenon occurred. They were able to see themselves, in what they believed to be seven years in the future. Just a glimpse, but enough to know what their lives would be like. Some women saw themselves glowing and pregnant. While most lamented their aging skin, they were pleased to see the interior of their happy homes and their eyes stared back with a content  and humble beauty. A few men saw a more successful, well rounded man looking back in the mirror. With a touch of grey and family pictures on the walls, they knew their life was on the right path. It was life changing, they claimed. An experience that altered their appreciation of the world, and a divine reminder of the simple joy of existence.I immediately found some super glue and spent hours collecting and piecing together the puzzle of shattered glass. I was prepared to see my future. But...looking into the mirror, I did not see my happy eyes or a smile of matured confidence. I saw a room. Lit by a single dangling bulb, the windows were barred and fingernail scratches littered every inch of the door.Only my nothingness stared back."

I was reminded of this on a recent trip to Petco.When _PERSON_ and I were in high school, we had a few pets so we would make frequent visits to Petco/Petsmart. I liked to meander and look at the reptiles every time. _PERSON_, however, would sneak into the sample buffet section of dog treats and scarf them down. It was really fucking embarrassing. She would grab some and hide in her pockets for later. But mostly she would grab a handful and duck behind an aisle, eating them hunched over with her arms bent like a hamster. She acted like I was a freak when I turned them down, and would get upset if I ""judged her"" for it. She insisted I was truly missing out and they're exactly the same thing as regular cookies. Her favorite ones were the round ones that look like knock-off Oreos. They were her ""jam"", as she liked to put it."
3d1qs2,18401,SkincareAddiction,1436733191,Advice with the basic routine: Please help,"I started the basic skin care routine a little over a month ago. I had combination dry skin with oil in my T-zone, and I am extremely fair. I use the recommended order of mineral oil, stridex pads, and cerave moisturizer at night. I don't wash my face every morning, but when I do I use the oil again and moisturize, followed by sunscreen.About a week in, my skin looked plump and beautiful. My acne was going away and I had high hopes. Yet, about 2 and a half weeks in, I began developing cystic acne like I haven't had in years. It seems to be like a staph infection, however I will have finished an entire cycle of doxycycline (from my doctor) today and the acne is still coming at full force. I quit using the cerave 4 days ago because I was convinced it was the culprit. This morning I was too scared to wash my face with the oil. Every day I wake up with more, in places I have never had acne before like my cheeks and under my nose.My question is, what the hell is going on? I don't understand why this routine would work so beautifully and then turn so ugly. I'm going to see my boyfriend for the first time in 2 months this week and I am extremely upset that I look this bad. Please give me some recommendations for how I should quit or alter my routine. Thank you. Sorry if this post is out-of-place but I am so desperate."
3dyycx,18401,shortscarystories,1437414602,I became a therapist to help people.,"I became a therapist to help people. But some people just don’t want to be helped. Marsha was forced to see me by her children. They paid for her therapy, telling me she was too shy to ask for help herself. They were worried because she never left her home. They made Marsha sound like a patron saint who isolated herself out of depression and anxiety, like some pitiful old woman who just needed a friend to talk to about knitting.Marsha was a bitch. She was one of those people that lived like they were already dead. You know the kind. Bitter. Rude. Entitled. Blaming everyone but themselves for what fraction of miserable life they have left. Marsha didn’t isolate herself out of loneliness or depression. She just truly hated everyone and everything. She did nothing, enjoyed nothing, and never had one positive thing to say. She sneered at suggestions I made for self-improvement. She insulted me repeatedly. She made my receptionist cry, and refused to apologize. One day, I snapped. I told her if she continued this way, she would die alone. I gave a riveting speech from the bottom of my soul about the power of positivity, and do you know what Marsha did? She spat on my floor.Marsha wanted to keep living like she was already dead. I suppose that’s what made her choking plea, “please, I don’t want to die” so sweet. For a beautiful moment, she appreciated life. I became a therapist to help people. But some people just don’t want to be helped. That’s why, for people like Marsha, I use more of a “hands on” technique."

I have been taking Lamictal 150mg for about 2 years. 6 months ago, I was prescribed Generess Fe, the only birth control that doesn't make me ill. This month I missed my period. I took pregnancy tests that turned up negative. I called my pharmacist and when she pulled up my file, she told me that the Generess and lamictal interact, making the lamictal half as effective!After bitching out my psychiatrist, he came to the conclusion that the Lamictal must not have been doing much anyway so he told me to break my 150mg tablet into quarters and take three of them (so 112.5mg) in order to taper off of them completely. For reference, this is my 3rd day on this lower dose.But wait! These mystery occurrences go back a bit: Flashback to July 1st I broke out into petechiae for no reason. Little red spots covered my entire body. I went to my doctor on July 3rd who ran some blood work and told me everything was fine. I was of course suspicious and looked at the bloodwork chart I received. On the TSH scale, I was a .52 on a scale of .3-4.0. I am unsure what that means. It is technically in the normal range, but it seems low and he didn't bring it up, they were rushing out of the office for the July 4th weekend.My petechiae magically disappeared after a week and I was never offered any reason. From July 1st to now, I have lost 10 pounds for no reason. I have insatiable hunger and crave carbs like crazy.Yesterday and today I have been dizzy and near blacking out when I stand up. Since late June, my acne is flaring up like it hasn't since I was 19, im fucking depressed and sometimes suicidal, difficulty breathing and currently nauseous. This all began with the petechiae and has spiraled out of control. My doctor is 4 hours away and I won't be able to visit him until early August. I feel like this is just getting worse and worse. Yesterday I had an emotional breakdown because I'm so worried about all these symptoms and missing my period.  I don't know if I should go to the ER or what! Please give me some advice of tests I should request or what I should ask for. If anyone has any ideas as to what the hell is wrong with me I would love to hear them. I just don't know what to do for the moment being. Thanks for reading this far."

Plus, I have to admit it’s pretty funny at how upset my colleagues get when they notice things missing. They yell “For Christ’s sake! It was labeled!” and “What kind of monster would do this?”It got to be such a huge ordeal that the office set out on a witch-hunt for the culprit. The long-time janitor was fired and blamed for throwing things out. I stopped stealing for a while and things went back to normal. But I couldn’t help peeking in the fridge and seeing all those treats staring me down. The temptation was too much and I grabbed a container belonging to the new girl, _PERSON_.

I dropped out due to depression. I work full time now and make enough money to support myself. But my depression has caused me to lose my girlfriend by driving her away. That was only a few weeks ago. I know I should be getting over her but I cant. I also had sex with a girl I barely know a few days after we broke up. It's something I regret heavily and threw me into even more of a depression. And then to top it all off I found out tonight that my ex already is dating someone new who was a mutual friend. I only have like 4 friends whom i dont always think really care about me. The only reason I'm not ending it is because of my mom and my sister but the urges are becoming ovetwhelming. I don't know what to do.

Like I'm doing something wrong when I hang out with them. I'm 18 years old, and I'm just a year away from going to college. I think my mom is just trying to keep me in her nest because I'm the youngest. She claims that one of my closest friends are a bad influence on me. I am  still the same person, I act and respond the same, I have the same morals and values; I haven't changed a bit -or at least I don't think I have-. Earlier today, she called me ignorant, arrogant, selfish, ungrateful, and a jerk. She says this is how I become after I hang out with one of my friends; thus calling him a bad influence. But I can't identify myself acting this way at all. Maybe I really am ignorant at what I'm doing, but I don't believe it's any of my friend's faults...Why would she call me these things when she can't justify my said behavior either?"

The issue did reside in my technique of bowing and how I was holding the bow. I didn't notice it, but I WAS 'hunching' my shoulders up.

This happened two nights ago at a house party-my own- It was a last minute party that my ex -we'll call him *_PERSON_- and my sister -*_PERSON_- and her ex -*_PERSON_- planned together. So, we're the hosts, and I know we'll have to communicate at some point, so I decide that I just want things to smooth things out. I didn't even want closure or to clarify anything with _PERSON_, just be friendly with each other. Acknowledge each other as normal humans beings again. This admittedly was difficult for me to do in the past year. So for the first hour I show up (from work), it's a nice party: dj, drinks, and all of that shabang. Next thing I now I'm in the same oom as my ex, unsure what to do, my drunk sister pulls us together and says, 'You guys should get together and talk things out!' I tell her, 'everything's ok, and chill. We don't need to do this. After another half hour or so, we keep bumping into each other. Soon enough we find ourselves on the pack patio, talking to just each other. Great conversation, it makes me feel so much better that he's treating better than he used to. For the rest of the night (up 'till 5am), we practically don't leave each other's side, while still enjoying the party as a whole. Now, about my friend *_PERSON_* -I'll try to make this quick-He and I have had an interesting friendship. While he's pursuing me, I don't want to deal with him romantically and vise versa. This has happened about three or four times. About a week ago, he drove to my place around 11:30pm and asks me to come meet him outside to talk. There he tells me how much he wants to be with me before it's too late *again*. I tell him I can't make a decision at the moment. Fast forward to this party, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ are actively trying to help me with fixing early morning drinks for people (coffee and teas),  but I  need to get mugs cleaned. They both fight over who gets to do what. I tell them, that they should go into the other room and relax. Not having it. _PERSON_ cleans cups, while _PERSON_ makes tea and I make coffee. _PERSON_ is showing distress that _PERSON_ and I have been spending time together. While I'm trying to let him know that I just wish to establish a friendship basis with him- which is the complete truth. Also touching on the situation between he and I. I told him that every time I think about he and I being together, I ANTICIPATE a break up. I know that's not something i should feel while going into a relationship, so I have to no to him. It's evident he hasn't accepted this. Fast forward a few hours (4am) everyone is passed out or has left. It's just _PERSON_, _PERSON_, and I. Really awkward situation for me. I ask it _PERSON_ wants to sleep here (my house) for the night. He says he'll just stay up, since he's had 5 cups of coffee. So there _PERSON_ and I are, wanting to sleep, and _PERSON_ refusing the sleep. So I go to my sister's bedroom, since it's one of the two completely available. I set up a bed for _PERSON_. We return to _PERSON_'s room and I lay down, so does _PERSON_. We all chat for maybe 20 minutes before _PERSON_ decides to head home. (Later he texts me that he didn't want to be the third wheel anymore. Didn't get the text until the next day, as my phone had gotten water damage.) So there _PERSON_ and I are, we end up trying to sleep-he smells amazing-I try to stay on my back and not face him, while he's lying on his back too. I ask him if he's comfortable enough, he then replies with 'kind of'. Asking him what I can do to fix that, he rolls over, and starts kissing me passionately. We both knew that we probably shouldn't have carried it any further, but we didn't. It was just like the hot sex we used to have. Probably some of the best sex I've ever had actually. After our session, we try to resume sleeping, as he turns back into the old _PERSON_ as before and makes up an excuse to leave..at 5am. Whatever. The next night, after work, _PERSON_ asks me if I had sex in her bed with _PERSON_, because she said _PERSON_ texted _PERSON_ about it and _PERSON_ told _PERSON_. Great. I forgot they were tight friends and told each other Everything. I told her yes, but now she's being passive aggressive. I did something I shouldn't have on so many different levels, and I feel really guilty about that. My ipod charger was stolen that night, and had to borrow hers. I said 'At least this one wasn't stolen' with a response of 'At you didn't have your bed fucked in'. She said she wasn't mad about it before. But the tone in her voice said otherwise. I still feel really bad about it. Now I feel like I don't even have the right to talk to her about anything that happened that night. She'll just get reminded and pissed off at me, that I did such a thing. As for the friendship with _PERSON_, he has now decided to get me the cold shoulder. Not sure if it'll be permanent or just a temporary month long thing.. he refuses to talk to me now. Anyways, I'm glad that this subreddit exists. I was going to talk to a friend, but writing Everything out feels much better. _PERSON_; At a house party, I caught up with an ex and had sex in my sister's bed. Sister guilt trips me as deserved, and because i spent so much time with said ex, my best friend won't speak to me now (pretty sure it's due to jealousy.)"

One was from California who loved to party, pledged, constantly invited strangers over, etc. The other was also a huge party-goer but was more into sports, so she found loud friends to bring over as well. The third one wasn't really an issue with noises, but nevertheless, I didn't like her. The third was usually out on campus 24/7 in the library, so that was nice. I kept myself shut in my room all year. We lived in an apartment. The third girl moved out because no one could get along with her, so i got that bedroom to myself. Which I'm thankful for. But, my bedroom door wasn't very soundproof. My roommates had company and mini drinking parties going on in the living room, kitchen and bathroom, all the time. It wasn't until a couple months later that a classmate gave me some wonderful earplugs. Anyways, back to the point. I don't know who i'm rooming with this year and I'm afraid she's going to be another super extrovert. I won't have an apartment this year, so I can't simply 'shut' her out like last year.

1l1aol,31217,harrypotter,1377396553,_PERSON_ 800 word prequel about _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ adventures.,"The speeding motorcycle took the sharp corner so fast in the darkness that both policemen in the pursuing car shouted,”Whoa!” Sergeant _PERSON_ slammed his large foot on the brake, thinking that the boy who was riding pillion was sure to be flung under his wheels; however, the motorbike made the turn without seating either of its riders, and with a wink of its red tail lights, vanished up the narrow side street.“We’ve got ‘em now!” cried PC _PERSON_ excitedly. “That’s a dead end!”Leaning hard on the steering wheel and crashing his gears, _PERSON_ scraped half the paint off the flank of the car as he forced it up the alleyway in pursuit.There in the headlights sat their quarry, stationary at last after a quarter of an hour’s chase. The two riders were trapped between a towering brick wall and the police car, which was now crawling towards them like some growling luminous-eyes predator.There was so little space between the car doors and the walls of the alley that _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ had difficulty extricating themselves from the vehicle. It injured their dignity to have to inch, crab-like,towards the miscreants. _PERSON_ dragged his generous belly along the wall,tearing buttons off his shirt as he went, and finally snapping off the wing mirror with his backside.“Get off the bike!” he bellowed at the smirking youths, who sat basking in the flashing blue light as though enjoying it.They did as they were told, finally pulling free from the broken wing mirror, _PERSON_ glared at them. They seemed to be in their late teens. The one who had been driving had long black hair, his insolent good looks reminded _PERSON_ unpleasantly of his daughter’s guitar-playing, layabout boyfriend. The second boy also had black hair, though his was short and stuck up in all directions; he wore glasses and a broad grin. Both were dressed in t-shirts emblazoned with a large golden bird; the emblem, no doubt, of some deafening, tuneless rock band.“No helmet!” _PERSON_ yelled, pointing from one uncovered head to the other. “Exceeding the speed limit by-by a considerable amount!” (In fact, the speed registered had been greater than _PERSON_ was prepared to accept that any motorcycle could travel.) “Failure to stop for the police!”“We’d have loved to stop for a chat,” said the boy in glasses,”only we were trying-”“Don’t get smart-you two are in a heap of trouble!” snarled _PERSON_. “Names!”“Names?” repeated the long-haired driver.”Er-Well, let’s see. There’s _PERSON_…Bathsheba…_PERSON_…”“And what’s nice about that one is, you can use it for a boy OR a girl,” said the boy in glasses.“Oh, our names, did you mean?” asked the first, as _PERSON_ spluttered with rage.”You should’ve said! This here is _PERSON_, and I’m _PERSON_ Black!”“Things’ll be seriously black for you in a minute, you cheek little-”But neither _PERSON_ nor _PERSON_ was paying attention. They were suddenly as alert as gundogs, staying past _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, over the roof of the police car, at the dark mouth of the alley. Then, with identical, fluid movements, they reached into their back pockets.For the space of a heartbeat both policemen imagined guns gleaming at them, but a second later they saw that the motorcyclists had drawn nothing more than-“Drumsticks?” jeered _PERSON_. “Right pair of jokers, aren’t you? Right, we’re arresting you on a charge of–”But _PERSON_ never got to name the charge. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ had shouted something incomprehensible, and the beams from the headlights had moved.The policemen wheeled around, then staggered backwards. Three men were flying-actually flying- up the alley on broomsticks-and at the same moment,the police car was rearing up on its back wheels._PERSON_’s knee bucked; as he sat down hard; _PERSON_ tripped over _PERSON_’s legs and fell on top of him, as flump-bang-crunch- they heard the men on brooms slam into the suspended car and fall, apparently insensible, to the ground, while broken bits of broomstick clattered down around them.The motorbike had roared into life again. His mouth hanging open, _PERSON_ mustered the strength to look back at the two teenagers.“Thanks very much!” called _PERSON_ over the throb of the engine.”We owe you one!”“Yeah, nice meeting you!” said _PERSON_. “And don’t forget: _PERSON_! It’s unisex!”There was an earth-shaking crash, and _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ threw their arms around each other in fright; their car had just fallen back to the ground. Now it was the motorcycle’s turn to rear. Before the policemen’s disbelieving eyes, it took off into thin air: _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ zoomed away into the night sky, their tail light twinkling behind them like a vanishing ruby.From the prequel I am not working on-but that was fun! _PERSON_"

I told him that adding basic seasonings are his best bet. Just use them moderately. I basically said, use lemon, curry powder, cumin powder, and cayenne pepper to whatever you want. [Of course, this is not excluding herbs]. And he argues back that adding all that crap is unnecessary and ultimately unhealthy while he's trying to lose weight. It started with how to make his brown rice taste better. But if he keeps refuting the idea, and thinking it as 'unhealthy' to moderately add seasonings, then I think he should just grit his teeth and eat the damn rice plain. Reddit, what are your opinions about this? Does adding few seasonings to make simple healthy foods, make them unhealthy? ps. The annoying thing about his diet is that he hates almost every 'good' and 'healthy' thing for humans. ie. avocados, seafood, tomatoes, artichokes, mushrooms, etc. It's almost aggravating that I can hardly cook him things that he *should* be eating. And now it looks like he's about to put brown rice on that list too. Update:We decided that I'll be cooking the meals from now on and he'll try to eat whatever I put in front of him.

Just makes it thicker. But you can still add more water to thin it out. But since we also added an extra cup of water, we added another 1/2-1 cup of apricot nectar. As for the 1.25 pumpkin juice, I just bought a can of real pumpkins. Like 12 oz should do. I also added a Tbs extra of pumpkin spices - because, who doesn't love that?The actual recipe -word by word- BY: BRYTON TAYLOR-IngredientsActual 'pumpkin juice'-half of a butternut squash-2 cups water_PERSON_ _PERSON_1.25 cup pumpkin juice3 cups apple juice½ cup apricot nectar½ tsp vanilla essence2 tsp pumpkin pie spice½ cup sugarInstructions -Start by placing your half a pumpkin or squash in a baking tray lined with a layer of water. Roast for approx 40 minutes at 180C until soft when fork is pressed in.-Remove from oven, cool and remove skin.-In a blender, combine the squash and water and blend. You can also put the pumpkin through the juicer, following it with water (putting just the pumpkin through does next to nothing).-In a saucepan, combine the 1.25 cups of the pumpkin juice with the apple juice, apricot nectar, vanilla essence, 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and sugar. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer for 20-30 minutes.-The whole point of this? By simmering you'll be reducing the water so it'll have a more concentrated taste and will help the spices infuse with the juices, which plays a big part in the taste.-Chill and serve (although served hot is wonderful _PERSON_: The creator of this recipe says that it's meant to be a copy cat recipe of the Pumpkin juice made in Orlando _PERSON_ _PERSON_'s. So if you have ever been to the world of _PERSON_ and tried their _PERSON_, I reckon it tastes like that.

My friend whom I've known since elementary school is going to teach aboard in a few days for at least a year. :( To celebrate, she decided to have a going away dinner and karaoke bar gathering last Friday. She invited me, my sister, some of her friends from college and several people from high school including this guy I used to like ""_PERSON_."" It was the first time I saw any of them in 6+ years.At dinner none of the hs guys said anything to me, not even 'hi.' One girl waved at me though. BUT in the private karaoke room, the guys I knew from high school sat on a couch together with _PERSON_ at the end. Someone had taken mine and my sister's spot on a different couch so we sat next to _PERSON_. I got up soon after to grab my jacket, which had been left on a different couch before someone took my spot. When I went back to sit beside _PERSON_, he said ""what did I do?"" (assuming I left briefly because of him) me; hm? you didn't do anything.-- During a _PERSON_ song my sister sang, he kept saying, ‘that’s _PERSON_! She’s really good.” I pretended to wipe tear, and said ""I’m so proud"" and he laughed.-- _PERSON_ I was raising my legs (I was wearing a babydoll dress and tights) and looking at my them/my shoes. When my eyes shifted to him he was staring at my legs/shoes.-- He playfully hit/slapped my shoulder after I said something.-- He insisted we sing a song together, even when I tried to pretend I couldn't hear the suggestion and tried to make him sing with my sister. I even said ""sing ***insert song*** it could be _PERSON_ Ft. _PERSON_.""-- We went through the song book and kept choosing songs the other person didn't know, and making jokes about artists like _PERSON_, One Direction etc. And he kept teasing me. _PERSON_. When I didn't know who sang ""Paralyzed.""Me: wasn't it Hoobastank?_PERSON_: No, it wasn't. It was a band with a name that had to do with hands or something. ***can't remember***Me: _PERSON_??_PERSON_: Yeah!Me: Really??_PERSON_: ***suspicious*** ***starts mocking me*** ""Who could it be?

So don't accuse me) I just have low self-esteem (and bad anxiety) and was glad for the attention. Hence, I'm wondering what it was about exactly. Plus, I think he knows I liked him once too. Ugh, I dunno why but I'm actually crying. Probably my depression/anxiety. -_- I dunno. Thoughts?"

1kc06m,4978,amiugly,1376460480,"[F] I have depression and anxiety, but am I ugly too? First Impression plz","I suffer from a lot of anxiety, social anxiety and depression, along with self-esteem issues. None of these issues are solely related to my appearance. Rather I believe I've convinced myself that all the ugly things I see in myself (internally) have manifested on the outside, and that I'm not an attractive person inside or out. I go through periods of being 'okay' but not happy with myself and my life to just plain hating myself and thinking of suicide. I've never dated, been in love or anything. I don't believe most guys find me 'attractive' or would like me if they 'really' got to know me anyway.I know none of you can help with anxiety and depression part (I can't even find a therapist because it's too expensive) but maybe you can give me an unbiased opinion of my appearance. Be nice, but more importantly please be honest. _URL_ shot: _URL_ I had a birthday in July (didn't do anything to celebrate and was very sick in bed that day) but yeah, please 'guess my age' too. Thank you."

1nahg5,4978,sex,1380337670,Older Male Customer Kissed My Neck Recently. It made me REALLY uncomfortable ... so why is it kind of arousing? Not sure what to do anymore.,"I run a small business with my sister, a shop that caters to subcultures like anime and videogames. There's a nice man ""_PERSON_"" who comes in sometimes with his teenage step-daughter. He's good to her and sometimes takes her to buy costumes for conventions, Halloween, etc.Anyway, I was a vendor at a convention over the summer, and at one point I looked over to the other side of my booth and saw ""_PERSON_"" waving at me. I was surprised to see him there, but smiled and waved back. What shocked me and made me a little uncomfortable was that after I waved, he touched his lips to his mouth and blew me a kiss. I masked my own discomfort by touching my hand to my lips and pointing at him. Then I turned away and went back to dealing with the customers I was with. A few moments later ""_PERSON_"" came over to me and started the conversation with ""hey beautiful."" (He knows my name and has never called me that before and I though I was a bit flattered, I was so shocked by the randomness that I didn't reply.) I'm pretty nervous/shy around people, especially guys but I tried to brush it off and changed the subject. We chatted a bit about business. (He needed a costume, and afterwards he reminded me that if I ever needed help around the house with plumbing to call him.) He introduced me to his youngest daughter who was in a stroller he was pushing, and I talked a little to his teenage daughter that was there too. I noticed that when we were talking he would lean down (he's taller than me) and stand a little too close and make lots of eye contact. I thought that could just be because of all the noise at the convention.**FAST FORWARD TO THIS MONDAY:** He came to our store for the first time in months with his cousin (now my family's friend and plumber) and his cousin's daughter. I was seated with my laptop on my knees, and before I could get up he came over to me. He said ""hi"" and then leaned over me. His face hovered over mine for a second, then he turned his head almost like he expected a kiss. I was frozen though, and confused because I thought we were just gonna hug. Then I thought he was gonna kiss my cheek, but instead he kissed right below it on my neck. I noticed that when he saw my sister whom he knows more, he just shook her hand.I'm 24, female, and socially anxious. I don't have much experience interacting with guys my own age (never dated or even had my first kiss), never mind men (I think _PERSON_ is in his late 30s or early 40s). He said he split up with his wife, though I'm not sure how long ago. I'm only interested in a friendly customer relationship with him. Still, the more I think about the kiss the more hot and bothered I get by it. Is this normal?**p.s** I'm just a little troubled by all this because I'm actually more interested in his cousin, who showed quite a bit of interest in me in the past. I was hoping to get to know him more, he invited me to drinks sometime. He was actually there when this whole kiss thing happened, and I just feel guilty and ashamed about everything since we've never hugged or kissed (I'm too shy to make a move, and he respects my personal space, so all we've done is shake hands. Although he did tell his daughter to hug us goodbye this Monday) I'm afraid he might've got the wrong idea, but I'm afraid to say anything/don't know what to say. I've never been good at expressing myself due to terrible anxiety and lack of experience."

I can't just ban him from my store since that means ruining things between my family and his cousin (our handyman) his daughter and niece. :( Oddly enough, looking back I kind of find the kiss arousing in a weird, gross way.

We'd text for weeks, and when I told him about my birthday in July he seemed interesting in what my plans were. We had/have a lot in common, but lately he's been ignoring my texts, and just doesn't seem to like me anymore. He periodically drops by my workplace (on business) and my house.

1pif75,4978,relationship_advice,1383099515,"Guys, what do girls do to turn you off or make you lose interest? Trying to figure out why no guy wants a relationship with me.","In less than a year I've managed to gain the interests of two guys and then suddenly turn them off to the point that they ignored me. The first guy was someone i knew from uni. We'd text often until he began to take days to respond to my texts, even when he'd text me first. He claimed it was school, his job, etc. etc. but I caught him lying once and flirting with girls online. I took it as rejection and stopped talking to him, ignored him in public and unfriended him on facebook. He tried to contact me via text msg in May, but I took a few days to respond back to him. Since then I haven't heard from him.Fast forward to this June - July with my fam's handyman wherein a similar pattern formed: we texted a lot between June and August  until, suddenly he stopped replying to my texts. When I'd call him (it was always business related) he'd apologize profusely about his lack of texting (without me ever bringing it up), blame it on work and promise he'd answer next time. That didn't happen. He visited my store last week. Only my sis was in because I was home sick. He talked to her briefly about the brickwork he's doing for our house, bought a toy for his daughter and left. He never asked about me. I think that's proof enough that he's not interested in me anymore. I want to get over him, and I think slowly I am. Although my feelings for him are turning into bitterness... (In his defense: I’m not really sure why nothing happened. Early this year, in the summer, when we were on texting terms I told him about my birthday in July and how I wasn’t looking forward to it. He said I should try to enjoy it and seemed interested in how I planned to spend it. I told him I didn’t have any plans but would try to think of something, and try to enjoy bdays again no matter how I spent it. I then asked him when his bday was and he responded with a one sentence answer. I couldn’t help wondering if he expected me to ask him to do something? But I didn’t know/think it’d be appropriate. Anyway, in the end I ended up being very ill on my birthday and didn’t do anything. And when he asked what I did for my bday, I told him this.)Still I can't help wondering what I did wrong in both aforementioned situations. Do *I* ruin/sabotage my own relationships? How? Was it because I never 'expressed my feelings' to either of them when we'd text?  I never told either of them that I 'liked' them. Or wanted to date. But that's because the opportunity never arose in my opinion. Was I supposed to just outright say it? I treated both guys nice enough, like friends. I thought 'taking your time' getting to know someone was the best approach, and that a guy would step up pursue a girl if he actually liked her. I'm at a loss.

Trying to figure out why no guy wants a relationship with me.","In less than a year I've managed to gain the interests of two guys and then suddenly turn them off to the point that they ignored me. The first guy was someone i knew from uni. We'd text often until he began to take days to respond to my texts, even when he'd text me first. He claimed it was school, his job, etc. etc. but I caught him lying once and flirting with girls online. I took it as rejection and stopped talking to him, ignored him in public and unfriended him on facebook. He tried to contact me via text msg in May, but I took a few days to respond back to him. Since then I haven't heard from him.Fast forward to this June - July with my fam's handyman wherein a similar pattern formed: we texted a lot between June and August  until, suddenly he stopped replying to my texts. When I'd call him (it was always business related) he'd apologize profusely about his lack of texting (without me ever bringing it up), blame it on work and promise he'd answer next time. That didn't happen. He visited my store last week. Only my sis was in because I was home sick. He talked to her briefly about the brickwork he's doing for our house, bought a toy for his daughter and left. He never asked about me. I think that's proof enough that he's not interested in me anymore. I want to get over him, and I think slowly I am. Although my feelings for him are turning into bitterness... (In his defense: I’m not really sure why nothing happened. Early this year, in the summer, when we were on texting terms I told him about my birthday in July and how I wasn’t looking forward to it. He said I should try to enjoy it and seemed interested in how I planned to spend it. I told him I didn’t have any plans but would try to think of something, and try to enjoy bdays again no matter how I spent it. I then asked him when his bday was and he responded with a one sentence answer. I couldn’t help wondering if he expected me to ask him to do something? But I didn’t know/think it’d be appropriate. Anyway, in the end I ended up being very ill on my birthday and didn’t do anything. And when he asked what I did for my bday, I told him this.)Still I can't help wondering what I did wrong in both aforementioned situations. Do *I* ruin/sabotage my own relationships? How? Was it because I never 'expressed my feelings' to either of them when we'd text?  I never told either of them that I 'liked' them. Or wanted to date. But that's because the opportunity never arose in my opinion. Was I supposed to just outright say it? I treated both guys nice enough, like friends. I thought 'taking your time' getting to know someone was the best approach, and that a guy would step up pursue a girl if he actually liked her. I'm at a loss.

I was a reluctant loner, and I fell into a really bad depression. Social anxiety tends to isolate you from your peers and then the sadness starts up. I had anxiety each morning before classes. My stomach hurt (full of butterflies) to an insane degree and I could barely stomach breakfast. I just felt sick with fear. In the beginning I tried to talk to people in my classes, the odd playful comment/or question here or there. I was always friendly during group projects/discussions as well.

Plus I miss being around my peers, but I don't miss the isolation, depression and anxiety that came with being around them ... if that makes sensel. I spent all my lunches and periods between classes alone in hallways or the library. I walked around by myself, made sure not to enroll in late classes partly because I have trouble making friends and my school was infamous for sexual assaults on campus.

The second last time we met he told his daughter to give me a hug goodbye. I worry he was hinting that he wanted a hug too.

Which would/did you choose?,"I'm 24, female, and suffer from socially anxiety disorder, low self-confidence, loneliness and occasional bouts of extreme depression that usually include suicidal urges and thoughts. I don't have any close friends, have trouble making them these days due to my anxiety and inability to form connections with people. (It's weird because I wasn't like this as a kid) As you can guess I'm a virgin, never been kissed, and never dated.I’ve wanted to try therapy for a few years now but had no insurance to cover the expenses, despite being Canadian. Anyway, after extensive searching I actually found a clinic in my area that provides free Anxiety Treatment programs and signed up. I was on a waiting list for 15 months. They *finally* got in contact with me recently, had me fill out a form and arranged a small interview with me. Now they've given me a choice between being in a 12-week group therapy session, or going one-on-one with a therapist for 8-15 weeks. The drawback of the one-on-one therapy is that her trainee (therapist in training) HAS to be at every session, which I don't really like the idea of honestly. (Anxiety issues and depression are such sensitive issues, and sometimes you have to reveal things about yourself you wouldn’t normally want to to just anyone). I’ve never opened up about some of my feelings before, and the last thing I want to do is be in an environment where I’m trying to open up, and someone is just there ‘sitting in’ on my session and judging me. Needless to say, I’m anxious about a one-on-one (two technically) anxiety therapy program. She said if I choose the one-on-one sessions they would begin asap, for an 1hr/week.If I choose the group sessions, they will start in May and go for 2hrs/week. I'm torn between the two therapy session choices, but my contact wants an answer by the end of the week. I kind of signed up for the treatment with the assumption that I’d be one-on-one with a therapist, but during the interview I was told that most people are placed in the group therapies because there’s just so many people and so few available slots for one-on-one therapy. (The waiting list is can be quite long). I began to warm up to the idea of group therapy given that everyone in the group will be people I relate to. I won’t feel as uncomfortable, and I’ll be with supportive, ‘safe’ people. Plus, I have social anxiety which makes talking to others, establishing relationships, initiating conversations, etc. so difficult. Hence, I NEED experience talking with groups of new people. This makes me lean toward group therapy. But my contact said although both choices are good, and she thinks I’d do well in the group therapy too, apparently people improve faster in one-on-one sessions which are more personalized. She says she doesn’t want to sway my decision on way or the other, but I think she wants me to take the one-on-one partly to help her trainee gain experience in this field. But the one-on-one sessions could start right away, whereas the group sessions would begin in May, and I’d probably be done with therapy by the time that time if I went with the one-on-one. Still I like the idea of a group… I’m torn between the pros and cons of both. What do you think I should do?? What would you do??"

2f6u3o,4978,relationships,1409598024,"Bumped into an ex-crush (22/M) yesterday and I (24/F) actually initiated a conversation. He said something that bothered me, did it mean anything? And was his behaviour normal of an ex?","I had a falling out with a guy I met in university almost 2 years ago. (He basically pushed hard to get my attention and and be my friend. He stared to the point where I was very uncomfortable and flirted a lot (although I was in denial at the time that he or anyone for that matter could like someone like me). It was when I tried to reciprocate his interest in the only ways I knew how, as I have no dating experience and have trouble (and fear) expressing my feelings, did he start paying less attention to me, and flirted with girls online. When I found out I was so hurt that I went cold turkey on him: stopped responding to his text messages, didn't go to his bday party (he had invited me) and didn't wish him a 'happy birthday' either. In addition I erased his phone number and ""unfriended"" him on facebook, and ignored him once when I saw him in public. Looking back I realize this sounds harsh or mean, but you wouldn't believe how badly his actions hurt me. I suffer from anxiety and endure terrible bouts of depression and thanks to him I was under a depression episode for a long time (crying, hating myself, blaming myself for him treating me badly by convincing myself I was unlikable and didn't deserve anyone). There were many times when I wanted so badly to kill myself, only the fear of pain stopped me from trying.Earlier this year in February, a mutual friend invited us both to a party. She didn't know about our falling out so she kept pushing me to talk to him, and was a little too drunk to notice my hesistance. Eventually I caved and tried to wave at him when I saw him in the room, but he just stared and looked angry. And we didn't speak that night. Not that I had expected/wanted us to at the time.FAST FORWARD TO YESTERDAY, I was at a convention on business and my ex-crush happens to walk up to my booth. In the past (when he was interested in me) he would come to my booth to say hi 3 times during the convention. This time he just stared around my booth. I had to do a double take since I couldn't believe he was there, as our booth was in a different location than it was last year. Then walked over to where I was sitting with my sister and just stared directly over my head like he couldn't see me. (Maybe he couldn't) Immediately, my reaction was to pretend I couldn't see him. Ignore him like we tended to do to each other these days but I decided against it and said ""_PERSON_ greeted me back, seemingly surprised and asked how the convention was going, why we moved locations and how I'd been. Awkwardly I just said 'I'm good.' I wished I had more to say to him but I couldn't think of anything out of nervousness/awkwardness. He said he still spoke to our mutual friend and they still hang sometimes. He asked if I kept in touch with her as well. I said ""on facebook sometimes but I haven't seen her recently."" Maybe I sounded sad since he asked how I was 2-3 more times. After that he said ""I'll tell [our mutual] friend you said hi."" As if it was an after thought he added ""... I don't wanna put words in your mouth tho.""This confused me because I adore our mutual friend, despite our lack of communication recently. (She even wished me a happy birthday this summer and told me she missed me and we should catch up with I'm in her city again. They both used to tell me they'd talk about me and missed me, and wanted to hang out again. (That was over a year ago when we were all on better terms.So I said ""No. It's fine. Tell her I said _PERSON_ said okay, and then ""bye."" We waved at each other and he quickly left.Some things have been bothering me since yesterday. I just need someone else's opinion on what happened, if this is normal, and what it all could have meant. Thank you.**TL;DR!** Hard to explain but I ran into an ex-crush (who acted like he was interested almost 2 years ago) yesterday. Actually he walked up to my table at a public event I attended on business. We usually ignore each other these days but I decided to initiated conversation (especially since he was directly in front of me). He seemed stupid nervous (I know I was) and surprised, and kept asking how I was. There's more, please read the full post. But I'm just wondering whether his reaction was normal for an ex-acquaintance/ crush. Also, he offered to say hi to a mutual friend for me, whom I haven't seen in a while but ""didn't want to put words in my mouth."" It sounded like he was going to invite me to hang with them, but stopped himself. _PERSON_ he's dating someone so I don't assume he's interested anymore."

He stared to the point where I was very uncomfortable and flirted a lot (although I was in denial at the time that he or anyone for that matter could like someone like me). It was when I tried to reciprocate his interest in the only ways I knew how, as I have no dating experience and have trouble (and fear) expressing my feelings, did he start paying less attention to me, and flirted with girls online. When I found out I was so hurt that I went cold turkey on him: stopped responding to his text messages, didn't go to his bday party (he had invited me) and didn't wish him a 'happy birthday' either. In addition I erased his phone number and ""unfriended"" him on facebook, and ignored him once when I saw him in public. Looking back I realize this sounds harsh or mean, but you wouldn't believe how badly his actions hurt me. I suffer from anxiety and endure terrible bouts of depression and thanks to him I was under a depression episode for a long time (crying, hating myself, blaming myself for him treating me badly by convincing myself I was unlikable and didn't deserve anyone). There were many times when I wanted so badly to kill myself, only the fear of pain stopped me from trying.Earlier this year in February, a mutual friend invited us both to a party. She didn't know about our falling out so she kept pushing me to talk to him, and was a little too drunk to notice my hesitance. Eventually I caved and tried to wave at him when I saw him in the room, but he just stared and looked angry. And we didn't speak that night. Not that I had expected/wanted us to at the time.FAST FORWARD TO YESTERDAY, I was at a convention on business and my ex-crush happens to walk up to my booth. In the past (when he was interested in me) he would come to my booth to say hi 3 times during the convention. This time he just stared around my booth. I had to do a double take since I couldn't believe he was there, as our booth was in a different location than it was last year. Then walked over to where I was sitting with my sister and just stared directly over my head like he couldn't see me. (Maybe he couldn't) Immediately, my reaction was to pretend I couldn't see him. Ignore him like we tended to do to each other these days but I decided against it and said ""_PERSON_ greeted me back, seemingly surprised and asked how the convention was going, why we moved locations and how I'd been. Awkwardly I just said 'I'm good.' I wished I had more to say to him but I couldn't think of anything out of nervousness/awkwardness. He said he still spoke to our mutual friend and they still hang sometimes. He asked if I kept in touch with her as well. I said ""on facebook sometimes but I haven't seen her recently."" Maybe I sounded sad since he asked how I was 2-3 more times. After that he said ""I'll tell [our mutual] friend you said hi."" As if it was an after thought he added ""... I don't wanna put words in your mouth tho.""This confused me because I adore our mutual friend, despite our lack of communication recently. (She even wished me a happy birthday this summer and told me she missed me and we should catch up with I'm in her city again. They both used to tell me they'd talk about me and missed me, and wanted to hang out again. (That was over a year ago when we were all on better terms.So I said ""No. It's fine. Tell her I said _PERSON_ said okay, and then ""bye."" We waved at each other and he quickly left.I'm mostly wondering if he was trying to be friends again, or if this is something I should leave alone. I'm glad that at the very least if we do end up at a function together I won't feel a blanket of animosity hovering in the air.I also wonder why he didn't think I'd want him to say ""hi"" to our mutual friend for me. I don't see her much since I left school and moved cities but we're still on good terms far as I know. I felt like it might have been a jab at me, because of what happened between me and him.

Thoughts??---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**TL;DR!** Hard to explain but I ran into an ex-crush (who acted like he was interested almost 2 years ago) yesterday. Actually he walked up to my table at a public event I attended on business. I initiated conversation and he seemed stupid nervous and surprised, and kept asking how I was. There's more, please read the full post. But I'm just wondering whether his reaction was normal for an ex-acquaintance/ crush. P.S. he's dating someone so I don't assume he's interested anymore."
2l08qg,4978,offmychest,1414874538,My friend (f/23) invited me (f/25) to her bday party and to sleepover which is cool ... only I have intense social anxiety... Need advice.,"We met in a writing class in college 1 1/2 years ago before I moved cities to work and was forced to quit school. I have social anxiety so dating, making and maintaining friends are very difficult for me. Anyway, our friendship started when ""_PERSON_"" added me to FB. After that I struck up a conversation with her in the hall one day, and we hit it off. She invited me to go to lunch with her and other classmates (her friends) every week for the rest of the year. She's a really friendly, nice person. She’d often randomly compliment me with ""you always dress really well/look so cool."" On the last day of class, her group and I went for drinks and she confessed that ""at the start of the school year she thought I was too cool for her group.” She didn't think I'd ever talk to them, but was happy to find out ""Wow, she's nice!""When I told her I was moving to another city we had this dramatic, long goodbye. She hugged me really hard a few times, and said she ""wanted us to be friends and keep in touch."" In Feb. she invited me to her 1st film screening, I attended. She insisted that I sleep at her house but I declined. She looked very sad.Recently I texted her. She wants to meet up when I have the time and get drunk and 'I can stay with her because she has a new place.' I also worried about the consequences of NOT sleeping over if we went out drinking._PERSON_ she get home safely?B. How would I? I live in another city and don't drive, cabs are expensive and buses run at weird times in the night/early morning.C. I'm not much of a hard drinker unlike her, and I've never been drink (only tipsy). I'm afraid to say anything though because I don't want to sound lame.I was mulling over all this when I received a text from her a few days ago reminding me that her birthday is mid-November. She said she’s going to have a little party on a Friday with a few people, but added that I should definitely come over and I could stay the entire weekend. :s I'm not keen on spending one night never mind an entire weekend. I don't know what to say though. She's very sweet and I don't want her to be disappointed or sad. I don't want her to think I don't want to be closer friends, and I don't want her to think I'm socially awkward by not wanting to sleepover.  I also want to avoid raising embarrassing questions. Overall I’m afraid of making things awkward. Totally at a loss as to what to do at this point. :(Also, I hate parties. I'm a wallflower tbh. I'm wondering if I should miss the party and hang out some other time (no idea when), or just drop in for like an hour or so and then leave…What makes the party more unappealing is that there's a guy whom she is great friends with, we used to like each other but things got weird and didn't work out, we're awkward around each other and I'd hate to have to deal with him. Not to mention, she lives several cities from me, and I'll have to commute by bus in the Canadian winter. I'm seriously considering telling her that my attending her party would depend largely on the weather, and that I'll be free before her bday so maybe we can hang out beforehand instead.Is this ok?"

I never knew how to take things to the next level, as I have no dating experience and I have trouble (and fear) expressing my feelings. Thus, he slowly started paying less attention to me, he'd ignore texts or take a long time to respond to them, and then apologize with excuses.

I was so hurt and depressed that I went no contact on him: I ignored his texts, ignored his bday invite, erased his phone number and ""unfriended"" him on facebook. I even ignored him once in public. Looking back I realize this sounds harsh or mean, but you wouldn't believe how badly his actions hurt me. I suffer from anxiety and terrible depression, and this situation triggered the worst depression episode I've had to date. I cried daily, hating myself, blaming myself for his poor treatment of me.

Maybe I sounded sad since he asked how I was 2-3 more times. After that he said ""I'll tell _PERSON_ you said hi."" As if it was an after thought he added ""... I don't wanna put words in your mouth tho.""It was awkward but polite. I wondered why he didn't think I'd want him to say ""hi"" to _PERSON_ for me. I don't see her much since I left school and moved cities but we're still on good terms far as I know. I felt like it might have been a jab at me, because of what happened between me and him._PERSON_ and _PERSON_ both used to tell me they'd talk about me and missed me since I moved, and wanted to hang out again. That was over a year ago when we were all on better terms. (_PERSON_ now has a girlfriend btw)Anyway, I've been depressed for a long time now and super anxious. I'm afraid my insecurities will be obvious at her small gathering and I'll end up ruining the mood of her birthday with my awkwardness, fear, and sadness. I texted _PERSON_ last week explaining that I get anxious in social settings like parties, to which she replied that she isn't super social either and that her party will only consist of 3 people, at most, including _PERSON_. The last thing I want to do is be a killjoy, or make _PERSON_ feel like she has to 'take care' of me. I worry about seeing _PERSON_ again too. I don't know what to do."
2nihxg,4978,getting_over_it,1417035695,UPDATE: A mutual friend invited me [25/F] and my ex-crush [23/M] to her bday this Friday. How do I deal with him and enjoy a party when I have social anxiety and depression??,"Firstly, thank you so much to those who responded to my  [Original Post] (_URL_ with kindness, empathy and useful advice. You helped me decide to ultimately attend my friend's party.I thought it was Nov. 21st but it turns out she told me the wrong date. It was actually on the 23rd. ;p I’ll warn you now that this is going to be a detailed account so feel free to stop reading right now if you like short and sweet stories.Anyway, my mom dropped me off nearly 3 hours after it officially started because we got lost. :( Upon arriving I knocked and rang the doorbell but no one answered. I decided to text _PERSON_ that I was there, and she texted back “coming!” Never knew one word could trigger so much nervousness. She opened the door soon after and waved bye to my mom. I waved at her too and her car drove off. _PERSON_ and I exchanged greetings. I wanted to compliment her but only managed to say “you look so nice” as we hugged. Her apartment was located on a higher floor so I followed her up a steep staircase and she told me that no one was there yet except for _PERSON_. She led me upstairs to her home and I followed nervous as hell, not knowing what to expect when I saw him. We were each other’s ex-crushes  and, as you know, things didn’t end well so naturally I was terrified to see him. A party with just the 3 of us  was the LAST thing I wanted. My plan going into this social event was to greet him politely and then try to talk catch up with _PERSON_ and hopefully make new friends, avoiding _PERSON_ the entire time if possible.  But nope! My plans were ruined. LOL -_-_PERSON_ was standing near the top of the staircase waiting for us. It was awkward and I didn’t know what to do.  I’m not sure who said ‘hi’ first, I think I did. But I remember _PERSON_ stretching out his arms for a hug, which caught me off guard and surprised me. I tried to recover from my shock and hugged him. It didn’t last long and it wasn’t the tight, almost suffocating hug he gave me in the past but it was a kind gesture. I gave _PERSON_ her gift and asked where I should put my boots and jacket. She led me to a closet where I put away my stuff. When we went back to the livingroom _PERSON_ explained that they had been watching TV. I was about to sit on the couch when I noticed how small it was. It only sat 3 people, and _PERSON_ had already occupied the spot furtherest to the left. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to sit beside him and even the far right seat felt *too close* to him for me. He was on a laptop, which connected to the TV and didn't seem to  notice my panic. I contemplated sitting on the floor but finally gave in and sat on the far right of the couch. (I felt so relieved when _PERSON_ sat between us.) She opened the gifts and seemed really grateful. She hugged me many times. One of the gifts I brought her was one of my favourite red wines. She seemed super happy about it. _PERSON_ recognized the packaging immediately as being from his workplace - he works at a chain liquor store. We discussed wine for a bit and _PERSON_ hurried to grab glasses for her and myself. None for _PERSON_ since he doesn’t drink. _PERSON_ asked us to describe the taste for him so he could relay it to his customers. I asked him how he got hired if he didn’t know his alcohol, and he laughingly said he had to ‘stretch the truth a bit.’ That started a convo on good and bad customer service experiences, but it was mostly _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ swapping stories while I listened. _PERSON_ filled in a lot of the silence with her chatter and I was pretty grateful. She mentioned that  she and _PERSON_ had been reminiscing about our writing class together and how a short story I wrote was still their favourite. We talked about school, my business and other stuff like videogames. _PERSON_ asked me about some game and I ended up showing him my 2DS (warning him that people criticize it for its appearance but that it really wasn’t too bad). But _PERSON_ still teased me about it, saying it looked like something from _PERSON_. We all laughed as I defended myself saying “It was a gift! And “It gets the job done.”Overall I wasn’t very talkative and was just listening most of the time but I tried not to be too silent either. I felt a lot more comfortable at one point, but I noticed that while _PERSON_ spoke and looked at both of us equally, _PERSON_ mostly spoke to and looked at _PERSON_. I knew it was intentional and that he didn’t feel very comfortable around me. There were also times when I’d be talking that he seemed pretty disengaged. I didn’t know what it meant, and couldn’t help feeling negative about it. Anxious thoughts filled my head like “maybe I’m imposing on the party.” “Maybe I shouldn’t have come because I make _PERSON_ uneasy.” Mind you, he made me uneasy too but I couldn’t help feeling a little sad. _PERSON_ poured us another glass of wine but soon she got up and disappeared for a bit leaving _PERSON_ and I alone. … My worst nightmare. It was quiet besides the show playing. I thought to say something to _PERSON_ who was sitting a seat away from me on the coach but I kept shooting down all the convo topics in my head. I turned away, staring at the floor. He spoke to me first, asking my opinion about something on television and we had a short convo about it. He asked about my business and our next tradeshow and we talked about that for a little bit until _PERSON_ came back.We all like the business-oriented shows *_PERSON_* and *Dragon’s Den,* so I told them about a really interesting episode that aired last week. Neither of them had seen it so they scoured the internet until they found the episode. We watched it together and enjoyed it. I asked _PERSON_ if anyone else was coming but she said only one other person a little later since she wanted to enjoy a quiet bday for once. She then suggested “later why don’t we go to a bar? Maybe even karaoke??” _PERSON_ spoke up first and said, “I’ll see how I feel later.”I didn’t say anything, wondering if maybe he just meant he didn’t want to hang out with me. _PERSON_ mentioned again that I could stay the night but my mom called saying she was coming to pick me up. I thanked _PERSON_ for inviting me and she said stuff which I forget because I was pretty tipsy, having drank 2 glasses of wine and barely eaten. But she helped me get my stuff and hugged me. I turned to _PERSON_ and remember looking up at him, thinking “I forgot how tall he was.” I looked down again feeling really awkward and suddenly nervous again.  I think I told him ‘bye.’ I looked up and again he was just stretching out his arms waiting for a hug. I was surprised but hugged him back, feeling awkward but a little flattered. I thought “he can’t hate me if he’s willing to hug me. But maybe he’s just being polite.”Anyway, when I went home I realized they had both “Liked” my business page on facebook! It was touching because they really didn’t have to. I texted them both saying it was nice seeing them. _PERSON_ said “it was nice seeing you too :) thanks for coming tonight, it was super fun. You have a goodnight as well!”We didn’t speak much so I wonder if he was just being polite, but yeah, that’s what happened. Now I’m wondering if I should just leave things alone, or if I should “like” his film page on fb, add him back as a friend. At the party _PERSON_ mentioned how grateful she was that I kept in touch with cards, and he just listened silently. Maybe I could surprise him with a Christmas card this year and a mini gift? Or is that too much? I’m not sure. I may not do anything. Still unsure if we were ever ‘friends’ and if there’s actually a friendship to salvage and mend. What do you think?Thanks for reading."

1bxqr6,43252,nuzlocke,1365449701,Dammit.,"I was doing an Emerald run, and everything was going great. I hadn't had a death since Flannery, my team was actually pretty well balanced, and I had just finished Victory Road. Looking back, I knew I was a bit underleveled, but I had some type advantages and plenty of money to buy full restores and whatnot, so I went for the Elite 4. And I wrecked them. The whole E4 couldn't take down a single one of my teammates, and I moved on to face _PERSON_. And he swept me. God dammit. The worst part was when I was down to just _PERSON_, my _PERSON_, and I had to watch his team just chip away at my health a little bit at a time. Shit."

The thing that I loved about both of them is that they are so well interwoven into the canon that they can basically be thrown in alongside a series reread and feel like an addition instead of an alteration. Also that they fleshed out characters that the main series sort of brushes aside. So my first request is if anyone has any other similar fanfictions, especially ones from a perspective outside the trio.My second request it to push me into something else. If you have a fanfiction that doesn't fit at all with what I've described but you feel it's worth reading, let me know. I love the _PERSON_ and want to see what else can be done with it, but the mountain of HP fanfictions is a little daunting to approach without a map."

jgf13,9333,shareastory,1313120931,inner city problems.,"So a few facts first up.I'm pro 420.(/r/trees)I have a job (43k a year)I'm 19 I have a one month old child and support both my girlfriend and my child in my own place in the city.( i rent not own.. yet)This city is plagued by females with low standards and apparently superfuckingamazing fertility, and a huge amount of douchebag, gangster, wanna be's, dead beat dads. Which thankfully I don't fit into that description.  I'll answer if you have quetions.It's gotten to the point where, the women have started to deal the drugs online to their facebook friends for their babydads/boyfriends.I'm sickened to call them Men.But the story i wanted to share is as follows.My Girlfriend and I struggled to be together because of our parents (her parents didnt like me and my parents didn't like her), but we did and in the end we are where we are. Seems we were the exception. This first friend of hers has a 7 month old child and is three months pregnant. She's married to a dead beat who robs people and small businesses for a living. He's a complete dick, who imo has hurt her before and is currently manipulating her into doing whatever he wants. It's very obvious he's cheating, she's caught him before. But yet after all this crap he's put her through she still wants to be with him. I shit you not redditors, i asked him what he was doing for his kids the first time i invited them for dinner, and he ""nothin i jusz ask my dad fo money,, then he writes that check and sends it. then i just go _PERSON_ stores and plastic to get by an stay fresh"". [i cant explain how horrible his english was, and it is the only language he speaks, English is my second language btw] That irked the hell out of me to the point where i just turned my back and put head phones on and just browsed reddit and imgur for the rest of the dinner.This Second girl, another one of my girlfriend's friends is also pregnant for the third time. Although she's never carried out a full pregnancy before. She's the shy, I'll-use-my-cunt-to-get-people-to-like-me type. She's defrauding the gov't by faking adhd and getting SSI checks.*** That's also what a lot of guys in this city are doing to get away from paying child support as it disqualifies them from support***  so she dumped him for this other guy who also is on SSI and moved out with him. great right? well, no. the guy's parents are taking his SSI money because he's not even fit to handle his own money or his own two year old daughter. thing about him is that he's unemployed and spends his whole check on weed and cheats on his girl, this girl however cheats on him. while pregnant just having rampant sex. So she was for ever complaining to my girlfriend and in turn me since i cant close my ears forever. but anyway, she then starts advertising that she's selling weed for her ""man"" on facebook.. i'm so tired of this and its really getting me down about society and if it werent for my family i'd probably give up on life and just ""go with the flow"" till some one shot me."

I lit up a small trash can on fire in my middle school while i was in seventh grade. went through the court proceedings i admitted I had done it because my parents being not very happy with me and currently seeking government ""support"" for me, didn't want to help me clear my name. (ie. SSI) but that's another story all together. let's just say it wasn't my parent's interest for me to get better. in fact they encouraged me to act out so ""we can money and _PERSON_ you what you need"".. which was them just not having to work and go to the welfare office. fast forward a few years later all is going great and i'm seemingly on the way to success until i tried to join the marines my senior year and was confronted by these charges and was DQ'ed. They said wait till you're 18 those charges shouldn't come up anymore. I live in pennsylvania I was under the impression that was the case once you turn 18. Well i tried once i turned 18 and was faced with the same problem. I was devastated It was the career of choice for me I honestly wanted to go into a military career, still do. Having issues with my parents i was kicked out two months before i graduated. having nothing and no where to go i looked for a job and started taking as many hours as i could and after couch surfing for three weeks i had enough money to rent a room. needles to say i had to choose between work and school. and being mad as I was I wanted to show my parents that I could make it.

1dbbh3,9333,Frugal,1367204824,Built a tv antenna for $0! No cable bill for me.,"All it really took was a piece of wood. Two wire hangers(they were coated so I used a brillo pad to get the metal as exposed as possible) a coax cable I found on the side of the building I just moved into and two screws.Clipped both hangers at about 20 inches, bent both in half and screwed them on a two foot long by one inch piece of wood each facing opposite ways. I then stripped one end of the coax cable (one end already had the plug for the tv) antenna. This part was a bit tricky and I cut myself. So be careful if you try this. Cut the black plastic ever so slightly so as not to cut the metal braid underneath it. Strip bare about 6 inches. Slowly pull then twist it and bend to the side for later do not cut it. Then you can peel the paper and use a knife to cut the white insulation to expose the copper. Head back to the wood piece with the hanger pieces screwed in. Wrap the copper on one hanger piece so it stays sturdy and repeat with the other that we had bent to the other side. Put tv to scan (i've got a vizio hdtv) and then adjust as needed. I only picked up 8 channels. CBS NBC in full HD the rest are local channels i've just now learned about.Im horrible at explaning things but if anyone interested in a more in depth tutorial im willing to make one. Its a cool little project and took about half an hour to make. Mostly because I was wincing from cutting my finger.

My mom was pretty verbally abusive, and on a few occasions physically abusive after she drinking too much.  She's very wild, with very intense mood swings, and when she gets mad, she gets loud, and belligerent and I'm a very very mousy person who's easily intimidated.  I just simply can not handle her.  She's okay in the morning but after her daily vodka or whatever she drinks now, she turns into a horrible bitch.   Every once in a while I'll dream about her and it's always one of those bad nights where she drank too much and we're fighting.  Last night, I was pretty hostile back, and I just remember being in a room, hiding from her thinking about how much I can't wait to get away from the cunt, and shortly after that, I woke up, realized I've been away from her for several years now and just basked in the peacefulness of a life with out her.  Could this mean PTSD?  I'm also very easily startled and I nearly shit myself if someone bangs on the door like the police, which doesn't happen often at all thankfully.  I used to be a lot more outgoing than I am now.  It happened within a year about the same time things got worse with her, my dad had the previous summer and I was pretty lively, the next year, I was a withdrawn shell.  He always thought it was me being traumatized, but I was tired of getting picked on, so I emotionally detached and just laid low and shut the fuck up, but maybe it was also her doing."

Unfortunately, it seems I do need some fun every once in a while, but  he never ever wants to leave the house and all his friends do is play card games (dbz, magic) and I just don't have the head for such games.  My ex's were a lot more social and I'd just sort of ride their coattails and live their life without actually connecting on my own to the people we were hanging out with, I had a social life without the commitment and I sort of miss it.   I can't break up with him, I don't want to and aside from this, we're perfect for each other.   I've already talked to him about this.  One night we were supposed to see ""the dover lights"" and there was this dark street we weren't sure if we were supposed to turn down or not, and he just decided to turn and go back home because he was too scared to go down it and I was pissed, there was a meteor shower that night too and I kept telling him over and over we had to go that weekend and I was actually excited about something for once, but no, it seems that EVERYTHING I ever look forward to never comes through and I literally can't sit here and put into words just how literal the EVERYTHING is.   I'm about to blow my fucking head off honestly.  You can't dangle cheese in front of a mouse and snatch it for 27 fucking years without the mouse giving up.  We were going to go to his friends for some July 4th shindig but his friend canceled and of course, we once again did nothing.  This applies to things we actually HAVE to do so we end up procrastinating a lot and shit ends up getting worse because it wasn't take care of when it should have been.  I've been trying to get better but he still makes a huge deal out of any venture outside and there are times I want to get mean and say ""man the fuck up, we gotta get this done"".  I'm shy too, but we can't both be doing this shit and in the past it used to my ex's who dealt with people but now it seems like I have to or shit doesn't get done or it's done wrong.  I'm tired of it.I can't make my own friends because I'm just not likable enough.  School, my mom, the babysitter, online, everyone fucking hated me.  I was just on facebook when a friend message me, I figured they were drunk because they were talking to me but they just wanted to see what my boyfriend was up to and then he stopped talking to me."
2aa1as,3202,socialanxiety,1404943477,Does anyone else feel like they have a broken filter?,"That's why I don't talk.  People used to call me stupid, and retarded all the time, and looking back, I believe they're right, I did say some stupid shit, and I was ignorant about shit I should not have been at my age.  We all know stupid people, surely some are self aware, right?   People tell me my posts don't make me sound stupid, but only in response to me calling myself stupid, otherwise there have been times that they have thought I was an idiot. I'm talking, my mom, the baby sitter and her daughter, at school, online, pretty much everywhere I tried to be social, I'd quickly learn I wasn't welcome and should keep my mouth shut.How exactly does one become confident enough to speak their mind after all of that?  I know for a fact it's not in my head, some people just shouldn't talk, we've met them, and I am one of them."
2azogw,3202,rant,1405632299,Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem....except when the problem isn't temporary which it most often isn't if you're killing yourself over it!,"If you want to piss me off, spout that stupid phrase while calling suicide victims selfish.  You have to fucking know the person and why they did it before you go around saying it was fucking temporary and chances are, there was more going in their head than they let on.  Just because someone kills themselves after a breakup, it doesn't mean it was JUST because of the breakup, the relationship was probably what kept them from doing it before, or maybe it was the straw that broke the camels back, but I doubt someone who has never been depressed, and is pretty well adjusted, would kill themselves after a breakup unless something else was going on.Also, so what if it's selfish?  Is it not more selfish to FORCE someone to live in misery against their will **who never asked to be here in the first place** (this can never be stressed enough, ever) just so you're not sad for a bit?  Which is more temporary, mental illness or the period of grief after someone's death?   Death is something people have to deal with, it's a necessary part of the life cycle, mental illness isn't and should not be and if healthy people get to opt out by leaving the mentally ill, we get to opt out by leaving it and the healthy people behind...period.  Don't say ""well even if you have no friends or family, the guy who bags your groceries will be affected""! because that's mind boggingly retarded.   We should man up and deal with shit like schizophrenia and bpd, but apparently it's ok to be thrown into severe despair because a dude you bagged groceries for once wanted to be at peace, the selfish evil bastard should've known that you, the dude he barely said more than a word to, would feel just a bit pensive about life and death, how could be be so cruel and put you through such hell!... Unless you were close to that person and will remain that way, you'll get over it and people who are close to the suicidal person are the only ones that get to ASK them not to do it.On that note, you don't get to tell someone that you're leaving them because they're crazy and that you're better off without them, and then tell them not to kill themselves because you're not doing it out of compassion, just guilt.   I had an ex tell me this shit and then tell me not to kill myself because it'd be his fault and why do I want to put him through that, as if it was ALL about him.  Everyone knows humans are social creatures, most of us need SOMEBODY, and if that SOMEBODY is always leaving...what kind of life is that?  Obviously the person isn't wanted, so either make them feel wanted by doing more than spouting bullshit, or let them leave and be at peace and YOU stop being selfish.If I want to end my life, I'll end it.  I never asked to be here.  I didn't ask to be the way I am, I didn't ask for everyone and my mother (not a typo) to beat it into my head that I was a worthless, idiotic piece of shit until I moved out of my dad's at 21.  I didn't ask for rage issues.  I just want to do what everyone else does, walk out of my pathetic life.  Why don't I get to walk away from me?  It's not that I don't want to live, I do...just not MY life.   I can't get the things from childhood out of my head, I can't get past the fact that everyone at work gets a bake-sale when they get sick and go the hospital but when I was deathly sick, I got nothing, and I can't get past my boyfriend who I thought would never leave, almost gave up on me, on us a couple weeks ago because I'm too hard to live with.  I can't stop being a retarded, socially awkward moron who will never have friends or a successful relationship.  I look at everyone and I just get so jealous, because they probably have brothers and sisters and a loving home, friends, hobbies, ambition, talents, a brain that actually works....I have none of that.  My life has been me being alone or treated like shit, or in a crappy relationship....it seriously has no substance to it whatsoever and it never will because I'm incurably shy due to being called stupid every time I opened my mouth.   Oh wait...all this is temporary though right... it'll blow over I'm sure.Don't comment just to be an asshole, I'm not saying that nobody does it for dumb shit, but it's their right to, and it's wrong to assume that we know why they did it before we even ask and it's silly to think that something to kill yourself over is always going to be something people feel comfortable talking to people about....people have secrets you know."
2d52w8,3202,SuicideWatch,1407670588,"I can't do this anymore, but I don't know what to do.","My now ex is currently packing his shit and leaving me.   Just like everyone else always does.  I'm just too angry and stressful to deal with and he NEVER wants to do anything involving people and just bums everyone out all the time.  No, I am NOT considering ending it JUST over a breakup.  People do that after breakups because the raw emotion propels them over the edge and they already wanted to do it, but they were in a relationship and couldn't.  Maybe some people do it just because of it, but I've been wanting to do it for a loooooooooooooooooong time.  I'm just either in a relationship or I have something holding me back.I'm never going to be able to have a healthy relationship.  I'm just too crazy and I really want nothing at all to do with men...but the only people who can stand me are men who are getting something out of me...and I just can't handle a life like that.If that's not enough, I have an abusive history towards innocent things...if you knew, you'd put a bullet in my head for me.  People don't change, abusers like me need to just die.  I'm sorry that I have to do one more fucked up thing, but that one more fucked up thing will end all the fucked up things to come.  I'm just so scared that I'll wake up paralyzed.  I have 200 sleeping pills.  I sat there and stared at them for like 30 minutes, but I've od'd on pain pills and that just made things worse...these are sleeping pills but that experience makes me scared to try...I don't want to be a suicide survivor and all that comes with it and I'm scared of how I'll feel until I die if it works.   I have a rope also.  There's honestly no point, I'm a bad person and I need to go.Edit: Not only is he not my bf, but we can't be friends at all.  I was trying to talk to him, and he was just like ""is that all, I feel like shit already""...and I just sort of lost it.  I wasn't trying to make him feel like shit or insult him, I wasn't saying anything like that, I just crying and trying to let some things out..but ""is that all"" is just a huge slap in the face to me...maybe i'm wrong, I'm always wrong and over reacting...even more reason there's just no point.Edit: 4 downvotes, guess I really should go."

Over the last five years I've researched psychological, neurological, and emotional problems that could explain my intense rage related to sounds that I have to endure on a regular basis, and hopefully some cure. As the years went on, I would have just been happy with an acceptable explanation.Nothing fit, things were close, but nothing described it just right. Then I heard of Misophonia. I cried when I read about how this was a thing and other people suffered, sometimes far worse than I do. I am in a hell that I can't explain to other people without sounding insane and I am not alone.Now that I have this to go off of, I am looking for ways to cope that don't involve me wearing headphones of any sort, or fleeing the area. Since both these actions can cost me my job, this involves me taking a deep look into what Misophonia is and how I came to have it.NOW!I have a few questions for you, if you don't want to answer a few of them, that's fine, I understand privacy and all.* 1. What are some of your strongest triggers?* 2. How long ago did you realize you had an issue with sound?* 3. If you remember, what was the first time you had a physical reaction?* 4. If you exhibited symptoms at a young age, what was your families reactions to your problem?* 5. Where there any significant times in your past that you cannot forget due to complications with your misophonia?* 6. If you work, what kind of job do you have?* 7. If you don't work, why not?* 8. Or are you in school?* 9. What is your age? [an age bracket would be fine too if you don't want to be specific]* 10. What region of earth are you from? [Closest descriptive area, or however specific you want to be, or general, just to get an idea]* 11. What emotion do you feel the most when you hear a trigger?* 12. How long do you think, on average, you can endure a trigger noise before you are compelled to react?* +13. What are your general reactions to trigger noises?* +14. What is your most successful coping method?These are all the question I have for now, however, if you have some you'd like to include to this list, that would be cool too.I would really love to talk about this a little bit, especially with other people who have a similar condition."

There is something indescribable that makes a person a person and I can't quite get it.I usually stick to pretty generic plot lines and fluff pieces because they make me happy and are easy to do, but I'm willing to give anything a try at least once.

They grew apart because the male started to fall into the bad crowd at school. The female was always a shy one, so she kind of just was normal. During high school, they completely drifted away when he started to pick on her and what few friends she had. After graduation she went off to college and spent her free time lurking on forums. She met a person on the forum and they both decided to not share any identifying personal information. No location, gender, age. None of it. They only talked about opinions and feelings, things that they didn't get express regularly.Unbeknownst to either of the two, they were talking to each other.Offline, they managed to attend the same college, they had a few classes together. Having him back in her life made her emotional, since she felt that moving away and burying that part of her had gotten her over losing her best friend.She sought refuge from these feelings online, talking daily with her mysterious online pal. Both of them began to feel feelings for their online counterpart. They wanted something more than they'd agreed upon at first.Which one of them will be the first to cross the line and seek out more? How will they react when they find out who the other person is? What will they do once they've learned about it?Now, the format that I want is that we actually exchange messages as our characters, not just typing out xxx sent xxx a message and close the window.This is how I'd like it to look at minimum.To: Your usernameFrom: My usernameMessage:Hey there, how are you doing today?This would technically be my first post if we are to play this out and we would go from here.

It was two AM and she had class in five hours. It wouldn't be enough sleep, but some is better than none she reasoned curling up into her bed. She pulled her blankets up over her shoulders and thought about what inspired her to help people.Her mind slowly crept back to when she was a little girl. Her best friend _PERSON_, her heart ached as she remembered everything.When she was 12 a new neighbor had move into the one empty house on the street. Alana had seen a little boy about her age and was so thrilled to see someone around her own age. She was the only kid on the block under the age of 16, so she had no one to play with. It was a nice summer afternoon when they met for the first time. Alana and her mother brought cookies that they had made over to their new neighbor’s house. ""Hi. I'm Alana. What's your name?"" She asked the boy. ""_PERSON_."" He said quietly with a mischievous grin. Without warning he poked her hard in the arm and shouter ""You're it."" and ran off. It was the beginning of their friendship. They played every day together that summer. When they started Middle School, they had a bunch of classes together, they walked home together, and they would do their homework at the park at the end of their street on nice days. Life kept going; they were nearly inseparable when they could be._PERSON_ was a weird phase for Alana, because although her body changed, she still felt like a child when she was around _PERSON_. Toward the summer of her last year of Middle School, they started sneaking out together and hanging out at the playground talking about things they were going through, watching the stars move, and then sneak back to their houses when it started getting too cold. On rainy nights _PERSON_ would sneak into her room and they'd make a fort out of blankets and quietly whisper about things.Her parents knew he would visit late at night every once in a while, but they never felt like it was much a threat to her safety. They were both good kids and kept out of trouble. Her father was weary, but only because a teenage boy was sneaking into his daughter's room. Her mother placated her father's worries ""Let kids be kids sweetie, besides, didn't you use to sneak into my room when we were younger?""The beginning of freshmen year is when things started to change. _PERSON_ stopped visiting so much. He started to date, and he started to push away from Alana. It was hard for her because she had no idea what was going on with him. She'd try and talk to him and he'd scoff saying it was none of her business.Yet, when he was lonely he knew she'd still be there, he would call her and ask for help with homework, when he bothered to do it, he'd call her with girl problems, 'You're a girl, right? You know how girls work.' She couldn't even talk about her own problems with him, because he was her problem. She felt so much hurt every time she was near him that eventually she started to push away too. Mid-year she came to the realization that she was in love with who he use to be and just wanted her best friend back.She left a note in his locker telling him that she needed to talk to him and to meet in their special place. Around midnight he finally showed up at the park. He smelled sweaty and gross. His speech was slightly slurred as he whispered for her. ""What's gotten into _PERSON_. Why are you acting out like this?"" She asked as she helped him get up to sit next to her. ""I'm sorry miss priss, I didn't mean to upset you with me living my life how I want."" He said sarcastically, not looking at her. ""If you have such a problem with me, then why did you come tonight?"" She asked pulling her coat tighter around her, cold in the night breeze.""'Cause I still care about you. You're my best friend, Alana."" he answered, giving her a nudge with his elbow when he said her name. ""You hurt my feelings all the time _PERSON_. That's not what best friends do. How can you treat me so poorly and still care about me?"" She asked, at this point she'd overwhelmed herself. She was hurt, sad, confused, aroused, and tired. She didn't know how to feel. She loved the way he was last summer, and wanted her friend back, but he wasn't the same anymore, and may never be again. Yet something about him, the warmth, the comfort of history, it made her want to hold on to him and never let go, which hurt even more knowing he wouldn't feel the same.""Why do you have to ruin such a nice night with such serious stuff? I have a lot going on right now, sorry I can't be around you 24/7."" _PERSON_ said, his words becoming clearer as the night became colder. Alana shook her head and jumped down off the playground, turning back to _PERSON_ as she adjusted her coat. ""You're right. You do have a lot going on in your life."" She said looking up at him, a tremor in her tone, ""And so do I. I love you _PERSON_, but I think that our friendship has run its course."" The boy looked confused for a moment before jumping down to stand next to her. ""What are you saying Alana?"" he asked in a serious tone.""I'm saying I'm done trying your friend. I'm not playing your games. I'm done chasing you. Don't call me, don't talk to me, and don’t visit anymore. I don't want anything to do with you, or this life you're living."" She told him. There was a moment of silence between them; it wasn't awkward, just sad. She left that night without another word, heartbroken, but for the better.Nearly a year passed since she ended their friendship, but it didn't mean that she didn't see him all the time, they lived on the same street. She saw him get worse and worse, there were parties when his parents weren't home, he smoked in a van around the corner from her place to keep out of sight of his parents. He'd been drug home by the cops a few times, but she didn't know the any of the details, nor did she want to.Shortly after her 16th birthday there was a faint tap at the window before it slid open. It'd had barely woke her up, but the realization that someone was in her room made her snap awake instantly.""Alana?"" A deeper, but familiar voice whispered. Her eyes were well adjusted at this point, he looked roughed up, like he'd been fighting, his clothes dirty and torn. ""Get out of my room."" She hissed under her breath, wanting to keep quiet.""I'm sorry. I need your help. Please."" He begged quietly coming over to her bed now that his eyes were adjusted to the dark of the room. She felt a pang in her chest as she heard the sadness of his tone. ""What do you need?"" She asked, expecting it to be money, or an alibi at worst. He didn't answer the question, but instead crawled into the bed with her and wrapped his arms around her shoulders and waist, pulling her to lay on him. He held her close, and tight. ""I'm so sorry."" He said nuzzling his face into her hair.Now that he was so close she could smell alcohol on him, it was much stronger than any other night she'd smelled it. She pushed away looking him in the face. His eyes were droopy and glazed. ""What's your problem?"" She asked quietly trying to push out of his grip. He rolled her onto her back, loosely pinning her down. He leaned in, kissing her strongly. ""I love you; I want to be with you, right now."" He whispered when he pulled away. He ran a hand up her hip and leaned in to kiss her again, she shoved up on his chest and tried to wiggle away. ""Get off of me"" She said, not minding her volume this time. He thrust his hips into hers and grabbed both her wrists up with one hand, holding them down above her head. He kissed her neck, down to her collar bone.The girl thrashed harder against him and started yelling ""Get off of me!"" Finally she got her wrists free and pushed him hard enough to make him lose his balance and sit up on his knees. She sat up straight and clamored to get out from under him.Her door flung open and her dad stood shadowed by the light. She couldn't remember much past that part of the night, her dad tackled _PERSON_ off the bed and on to the ground; she hid in her parent's bed, crying on her mother's shoulder while her dad called the police.He got hauled off and Alana missed school for a few days. Her parents would ask her if she was okay, but Alana was stunned into silence. She didn't see _PERSON_ ever again after that night, and probably for the best. A few weeks after that her dad told them he'd accepted a job in Seattle and they'd be moving across state.She finished out school, getting counseling twice a week, till she was able to move past the incident. She began to take a deep interest in motivation, what drove people to do what they did, using that to help people resolve their problems.That's why she helped people. She never knew why he came into her room that night, she probably never would. Maybe she never did want to know? These thoughts and memories bounced around her mind until she drifted off to sleep. The morning came too soon, and her phone buzzed to wake her up. She dressed in jeans, a plain white tee, and vans before leaving her room in the dorms to make it to class on time. She was a sluggish when she made it to the coffee cart in the student court-yard, ordered her coffee and headed to her first class.She felt a little more awake now that she had coffee in her system. Around mid-day she finally had one of her favorite classes. Psychology. The things she learned and did in that class were the only thing keeping her in school still. She took a seat in the middle of the room and pulled out a notebook, waiting to for the class to start._PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON__PERSON_PERSON_PERSON_Made it this far?

Till it slaps me in the face and say ""hey. Go fuck yourself.""I have DID. It's not that bad sometimes, usually we all try to work together, but there is this one. this fucker. I swear. it's out to get me, push me over the edge. really fuck up my life in ways that are small and insignificant, but bad enough that they ruin me.Today, I spaced out for about 3 hours. It happens. I trust my others to do my job when this happens, normally I don't panic because the horrible one doesn't ever take control. . . that I know of.I guess it did today and I got called out by my team leader for not doing my job. Normally I can take a hit like that and not be rattled to the bones, but the way she did it. She called me a liar when I asked if I could explain. She said that she wouldn't believe me even if I did. She scolded me like a child and it whipped me right back to when I was a kid and listening to my mom berate me.The way I grew up gave me a little PTSD that I cope pretty okay with, but fuck. When I trigger, I'm lost. It's game over. I turn into a mess.My husband took a break from his work to come have lunch with me since we work in the same area and I couldn't stop crying.I wanted to stop, I want to suck it up and bury it all away, but I can't. This is one gigantic problem that could get me fired.I was one medication for the longest time, and it was going great, then I got pregnant and had to stop taking everything and I'm starting to think that this is an absolutely horrible idea.My husband tried to calm me down, but nothing was really working, people were trying not to stare, but they were.Towards the end he broke down a little too and explained that this pregnancy was a horrible idea.He pointed out that at some point I'm going to check out and he's going to be left taking care of me and I know he loves me, and I know he's probably right. It just hurt so bad.I'm bringing a child into this world and I can't even take care of myself. I am probably going to be so mental checked out when I get older that I'm not even going to see my child be a productive member of society, saying I don't fuck up.My husband is going to be left holding everything while I pretty much check out of life.So I'm sitting here thinking about all the ways I could die. To save him from having to do any of that.but I can't. I can't do anything because I know how bad it would hurt him. I love my husband. I just. . I don't want to be alive anymore.I'm tired of fighting every day. I'm tired of waking up and hearing that voice remind me how much of a fuck up I am.I'm tired of everyone around me treating me like shit because they don't know what's going on, and the few people that do know what's going on don't know how to help me.I am tired of my management singling me out because I'm 'bad'.I'm tired of being called a liar even though I have no fucking clue what I'm lying about.I want out.I don't want to be the responsible one anymore, I don't want to be strong anymore.I tried and I can't do it. I don't have a support structure to turn to. I've never had one. I don't even know who to reach out to for help, especially at work because I don't trust my management.. . . I just can't do it and it hurts so much. I want to stop crying. I want to stop living.Just till I can be on my medication again. Then maybe it will get better."

23csba,6792,relationship_advice,1397828763,"a friendship is a relationship, right?","so I got two questions. two things happened on the same day, trying to figure out how to get past them. been having a hard time lately with lots of troubles and difficulties. I visit my friend on a weekly basis, two or three days. anyway, feeling a bit down and generally irritable, trying my best to not let it get in hte way of stuff. realy relishing the idea of going to my friends house to try and lift my mood.of course it's not always that simple and i have gotten frustrated when we been playing whatever video game we want to play. I made a mention that i thought I'd done really well because normally when I get frustrated i just give up or throw the controller. I said I hadn't given up on the game and thought I'd done well.  he said ""you know it's no fun for me either when you come here in a bad mood"". I just thought.. wow, kick me when i'm down why dont ya? really i didn't see why he needed to take a swipe at me like that when it was clear i was having a hard time and I even managed to do really well not letting it get in the way.Then later on in hte day, we wer talking about animals and how some animals are mistreated. then he decided to criticise me for lightly flicking his cats nose when she tried to stick her nose in my food and when that cat had actually came up to me and swiped at me with her claws giving me a nasty scratch. I felt totally unsupported, like I was being attacked and essentially bullied by his cat and i'm not allowed to do anything. so what do i do. seriously, I wonder if he doesn't even care about my wellbeing. to be fair, he has supported me in a lot of other ways. he looks after my spare keys in case i get locked out of my house. he lends me his bike on a weekend, he helps me with my garden, he tells me if i ever need food like if I am short, then I can go there and they can help me out that way. it's not like he doewn't have his ways of showing that he is a good friend, I just get stuck at times like this when it seems like he doesn't care about my wellbeing."

26g4x3,6792,AskScienceDiscussion,1401029702,what if time is a physical dimension?,"so yeah, that is an idea I just had, what if time is actually a physical dimension but is actually much slower than the other physical dimensions? when I say slower, I mean slower to propagate it's effects on things.the reason I say this is because I like to think of another reason for redshift as I do not like the assumption that it means the universe is expanding. it's too lazy. So I am always thinking about possible other reasons for redshift. that is what made me think of this. if time is physical as well as timey wimey, then as things travel over a long distance, the time taken adds extra distance onto the journey. so if you travelled 6 gajillion miles at 5000 mile per second then you'd end up going 7 gajillion miles, but if you travelled 6 gajillion miles at 4000 miles per second, then you'd end up going 8 gajillion miles total.just an idea."

I know doubting is to be expected. It's odd though just how much doubt there is, it's like my whole being is rebelling. My reasons for starting HRT were focused around some very specific difficulties. I am 98% sure my brain is not wired to cope with testosterone and I have felt a million times better since I started suppressing it. I'm in control of my life for once. I used to be scared of having spare spending money because I'd spend it on my sex obsession. that is gone now. The uncontrollable rage has gone. I feel more like myself. I have money in the bank and I am happy to leave it there and not tempted at all to spend it on something useless. I'm also happy that I am going to start to see a reduction in my abdomen size and more size around my thighs etc. Also looking forward to my hair improving. Here is the problem. I have noticed my skin getting softer and I feel vulnerable. I don't like that. I figured it's just something I need to get used to. obviously I'm gonna have to adapt to a lot of things. Another thing, just now I looked down at my chest and imagined what it would be like with breasts. It was weird. I'm not sure I totally understand what that will be like, but...

'sh' is not welsh grammar as far as I have learnt or aware of.

2ekyqr,6792,asktransgender,1409013529,confused about sexuality,"Looking for some comparison stories, not really after answers, just clarity. always was 'into' women, but was sort of weirdly into guys parts and thought I might be bi for a long time, but to be honest, never really wanted to be in a relationship with a guy. Thing is though, I have never really had a proper relationship. looking at adult movies I always got the desire to be in that situation doing what that man was doing, but it never translated into real life. I got into one night stands with women, and more often than not, I just did not really enjoy being there. it was too much like hard work. I always got the desire though so I never doubted that I desired women. I tried being up close and personal with men but I always got really scared and freaked out.  I always saw women and their bodies, something I wanted to interact with, wanted to touch them and etc. but when I got into that situation, it was just sort of 'meh'. I could never understand it, how could i have a strong desire and it just doesn't pan out? it never made any sense.I never found that I fancied guys though, so I have not considered the alternative. only ever really 'enjoyed' sex one, that was the one time i did without a condom and it was just out of this world, but I was sort of gone into a trance and I realised afterwards that I did not feel like myself. it was like I 'wasn't me'. Well after I been on hormones for a while now, I am getting less interested in adult movies. I'm trying to find my sexuality. it's difficult.  the old tricks don't work so well. I still have desire for the beautiful women I see.. but I realise that any kind of gratification I might seek just will not work as it used to. I am starting to think this desire I am feeling has gotten all mixed up and all along, the desire i felt was the desire to BE that woman, not to be the man WITH the woman. I'm starting to think... perhaps I don't actually fancy women at all.Maybe I didn't want to take an interest in men because I didn't have the right pheromones and hormone balance etc, but maybe also because I never want to be a man with a man. I don't want to be with anyone who is interested in anything that looks like a penis or wants a person who looks like a man. I really just don't know what I want right now. maybe I am in the same miasma that pre-pubertal girls find themselves.I like the idea of dating and I'd like to be taken out to restaurants etc. I want to feel special and like a princess. But I'm scared of what it all implies. I don't really feel like I am at all prepared to get intimate with anyone. I would like to keep that to myself for now. or maybe I might want to explore with the right person. I'm just not sure. It's all so confusing."

I'd made it clear I was not looking for anything intimate and wanted just to date initially so I was pretty sure he wasn't a creep. Well he decided he wanted to ask me something awkward so I was like.. okay... he asked me if I 'have a girls body'. so well.. I said that since I was only looking for dating, then I can tell him I'm quite slim and not masculine figure at all really and that's enough.Then he asked  me ""have you got a willy"" well... I was fairly frank with him, I said I didn't think it was appropriate to ask a girl about her genitals regardless of what congenital conditions she might have. then he became kinda creepy desperate. So anyway... not sure what that was all about. I think he was just a poor lonely guy and I hope he finds someone nice who he can make into his princess. I just wondered if my response was appropriate or should we give more leeway with regards to those types of things. I suppose everyone will have a different opinion.

I'm quite slim but there is just too much stuff at the front. I know that the position of genitals is different on different people. for some it sort of comes out from underneath! I would imagine tucking would be really easy for those people. if tucking could be done effectively, I think srs would not be as much of a priority as for somebody who has a problem with a disturbance at the front of the pants or skirt, or who simply cannot look good in a bikini.If I could simply and easily 'put it away' out of sight, out of mind, I might not be so set on surgery. This is my thoughts on the matter, perhaps some people could confirm?"

So since I was about 16 or maybe earlier, I have found that if I study my own body for extended periods I sometimes get a horrific feeling of doom. It's like I feel sick to my stomach, but not physically. I feel like I want to just leave my body and never come back. I feel like i want to die. It seems like the only escape from that awful feeling. It seems like it's related to anxiety, it is that kind of feeling, but no adrenaline rushes or anything like that. it's just a feeling that my whole existence is so sick, so poisoned, that I can't bear to exist. It doesn't happen often, most of the time I'm fine. but then at times if I focus on my body, even if I think I'm looking good, something happens and I get this feeling of doom. Since I am only at 3 months HRT I don't know if correcting my body will resolve this feeling that occurs and so I can't say if it is gender dysphoria or not that causes it. I mean, I'm not questioning my transition at all. I'm just wondering if I can connect these two things together or not. Does this sound anything like your dysphoria or do you feel something different?"

2gwvoq,6792,asktransgender,1411174890,When did your dysphoria turn into euphoria?,"Following on from my previous text post ""what does your dysphoria FEEL like"", I want to know when did that situation turn from one that brings you dysphoria and into a situation that gives you euphoria instead?I am interested in this because I just experienced the situation that normally gives me dysphoria and got euphoria instead because I could see a change for the better. I have always experienced horrible dysphoria when looking and focusing on my chest and the way it looks. This evening I experienced the opposite. I had bought a new tank top and it had previously looked horrible, but this morning I noticed my shoulders a lot thinner at the back now, so i'm very ladylike up at the very top even if my other parts still hasn't finished changing.This evening I put on the tank top to see how it made my shoulders look, and I noticed something amazing. The tank top really accentuates my boobs that I had previously thought were still not really visible! I usually wear a black t shirt and it's not very tight fitting or contoured. I can't tell much when topless either. I'm not well developed, certainly not an A cup or even half that, at least I didn't think so. But with this top on, they look like the right shape and for the first time ever I was looking at me and my torso actually looking like a girl! well I thought I would study my chest for a bit, the type of activity that normally gives me dysphoria, wanting to see if it was different. this time my body  appears female to me. I tried prodding a bit, all the things that normally make me feel terrible. feeling changed, but this time it was good! :) I should describe it... It's almost like a sexual feeling but it's NOT arousal. I've had this feeling many times before, mostly on occasions when I was happy. I've only been experiencing it over the last year or so. before that, I was on emotional shut down. So I found that this situation that normally gives dysphoria, is now giving me euphoria and all because of what 3 months HRT has done for me! I hope you reading this have also experienced this kind of change.  if not, then it's something to look forward to! If you have then tell me about it!"
2h1szv,6792,asktransgender,1411321712,Should I try to gain weight?,"I'm at 3 months HRT and seem to be stuck at 12 stone. (168lb)I've been doing a lot of cardio to try and slim myself down, lose muscle faster. I noticed that cyclists and runners are usually quite skinny so that's my reasoning. Thing is though, it doesn't seem to be working too well. maybe it's not enough cardio, I don't get much time and tend to go cycling for about 20 minutes. Maybe I should go the other way?I read elsewhere that If I gain fat, then due to the HRT, the fat will be placed in all the right areas. I don't really want to be overweight, but maybe this would help me to get a better figure faster?"
2hdlko,6792,asktransgender,1411599769,trans and transphobic?,"really not sure if this is true or not... I think maybe this is a case of instinctive self determination.. possibly. anyway I don't like the term trans if applied to myself. I know many trans people and they are great. I had a problem when trying to figure out what exactly is going on with me. I knew i wasn't a man, and it took me a long time to decide I am a woman, I'm thinking it may be because I can't stand the idea of somebody thinking of me as a woman who used to be a man. I take the stance that I was never a man, I just looked that way. Well all the evidence suggests xxy chromosomes. the hormone imbalances, the slight gynecomastia, the slight discrepancies in the downstairs area, metabolism discrepancies, etc. so that would make me intersex. I mean, even just with the hormone levels I had, technically I was intersex anyway. So I'm wondering does it seem reasonable that on an instinctive level, I knew i was intersex and so identifying as trans was wrong for me? or is this something else, have any of you had feelings of trans phobia and difficulties with self acceptance? yeah I know silly question isn't it..."
2hpds4,6792,asktransgender,1411919995,ways to deal with old identity,"I'm interested in ways people deal with issues related to the name they grew up with before deciding to transition. I decided to try something today. I thought I can find a way to deflect the name from me and onto another entity. I thought about when I was younger and had an imaginary friend called _PERSON_. Each time I heard the name _PERSON_ I thought of that imaginary friend. So I thought, what if I can create an imaginary friend with the name I am trying to avoid thinking about. I actually went one step better. I have a stuffed monkey that was a gift from my mother, I hadn't named him yet so I decided to name him the name I was running from. I also have a little keyring f a dog. I also called the dog that name. Hopefully, any time anyone uses that name from now on, I can deflect the name onto these two characters. I've asked people not to use that name but I understand it['s difficult for them, so when they slip up, I can simply consider that thy are talking to the little dog. when I hear the name on TV I can recognise it not as a name I was previously familiar with for a certain reason.. instead I think ""Oh that's the same name as my monkey!""I think it might help until I get to a point where I can open a dialogue with my past self and reconcile."

I don't know what to do. I could try contacting the girls on dating sites but I'm afraid. I don't want to be in the same situation again, chasing after girls and them just doing nothing.

I want to make a proper effort because I am finding my true self and I really want some intimacy i my life. I've been alone for 34 years and I am so sick of the loneliness and the crippling jealousy when I see other people talking about how great sex is. I need to make a start.I'm transgender, started life being labelled as a male, but my hormones are all messed up anyway and I developed quit effeminate and I definitely have a female brain. I've been taking hormones for about 3 and a half months and have been called Lady once by a stranger so I'm getting there. I made a dating profile on a dating site and I'm finding it to be very soul crushing. I have always believed that I was into girls so that is my default. I do like the sound of a female voice and am comforted by a ladies touch (hugs from friends) so I'm pretty sure I'm looking the right direction, but I have also considered dating guys too. the contrast is quite stark. I switch my profile to men, I get a full inbox, I switch it to women, I don't even get a single view of my profile. I feel like I'm gonna have a lot of rejection if I start messaging girls, but I get no attention anyway so I'm really wondering what to do. I should be bold and contact them right? but what if they avoid me because i look just a little too much on the masculine side?I've always been in the part of society that has to do all the chasing, I always completely sucked at it, I just wasn't built for it I suppose. But am I doomed to have to continue that cycle of making first contact and having to do all the work? or is this a common problem in girl-girl relationships? I suppose it probably is. but why no attention at all? maybe trans = bad? I'm throwing up a lot of assumptions here... I suppose I should just cut to the chase....TL;DRHow can a trans woman best meet a girl?"
2irofl,6792,asktransgender,1412870337,ideas on how to make a really good gaff (tucking),"I was basically thinking of a good way to make a really good tuck without having a situation where you can't use the bathroom. so here are my thoughts so far. a bikini front with everything cut off it. a strip of velcro hanging from the bottom. sports tape the bikini front to the front of the body, sports tape the other velcro to the back of the body, use the velcro to pull the bikini over the offending area and stick to the back. Surely this creates an effective solution? I haven't tried it yet, I just ordered some velcro, but thinking about taping everything in place, doesn't seem to make sense when there is a temporary solution in velcro. I'd like some thoughts and feedback and any additional ideas please :)"

I took an extra 25mg of spiro with one capsule of P last night and today I was hornier than ever. like, at the same sort of level as before I even started HRT. I am sure this is not right. I have been feeling more masculine today, certainly NOT what I want, and I have found that i produced more semen than expected. is this just bad progesterone or do I have an unpleasant reaction to progesterone in general? have you ever heard of this?I should probably also mention my hormones were not normal levels before HRT.

I'm not the sort of person who is crying out for attention or hates myself. I love myself, more than anyone else in the world. I want to see myself do well, I want to see the future me.

I've been given a council flat, but it is a converted house and the floorboards above have been replaced with fibreboard. It is literally like being under a stage or a wrestling ring. even if the upstairs neighbour isn't slamming windows or slamming doors or dropping stuff on the floor, etc, just walking about causes a huge racket. I've been stuck here for 7 months already. I'm an introductory tenant so I can't just swap with somebody. I have to wait another 5 months before I gain that right. I live 3 miles from my family and friends and have no transport. There is nothing round here, not even a convenience store. I don't have spare money to call a taxi and go to a club or whatever. I have nowhere else to go. I am stuck in this flat. It's the only place I can make my food, check my emails, watch any movies or play games etc. I'm trapped and being bombarded by noise. I found somebody who wants to swap with me and this has been my sole focus. if I can get somebody to swap and convince the council to let me, then I can be saved. but recently I've been trying to put paperwork through, I have a doctors note and everything. what if they say no? I don't know if I can cope with any more. Is there anything I can do. Is there some way I can somehow get rid of the noise or some way to cope somehow...

I really liked her and wanted to spend a lot of time with her. I felt drawn to her. here is the issue though... I thought about if I would want to kiss her and really could not say yes. I mean I would not mind and it might be nice and I think I'd enjoy rolling around naked with her etc... but I don't feel any magnetism in that sense. so I don't understand what this attraction is that I have to her. is this a normal platonic thing? perhaps any time I was drawn to a girl in the past was also platonic and the testosterone in my body was confusing me?If anyone can relate to any of these feelings, I would love any insight you could give me.

35ln16,6792,asktransgender,1431355867,question about surgical methods,"Hello, I've been studying anatomy of the vulva again as I'm sure we all do. I was thinking, I do not really like how in most surgery results, the labia minora do not appear to meet at the bottom of the vaginal opening. at least that is how it appears in most photos. I guess with a penile inversion technique, it is difficult to manipulate the penile foreskin into that position. My problem with that is that the end result won't be quite as authentic as I would like. personally, I want something that is as close to what i should have had as is possible. so I've been thinkig of ways this could be achieved. in my view, scrotal tissue should be used to construct labia majora and penile foreskin should be used to make the labia minora and the penile glans should be used to make the clitoral glans. I'm not saying this is right for everyone, but in my case, I feel this is important. I realise this leaves no options left for forming a vaginal canal. well I have read that there are cosmetic GRS available.  surely this can be achieved? a vulva that appears pretty much identical to a natal developed structure. sex would be an issue, I get that, but there are girls who are born with malformed vagina. there is a doctor somewhere in europe that has created lab grown vagina and implanted it in these girls. I don't know how long it might take, but I am sure one day that can be made available on a wider scale. there are even readily available donor cells. the cells of the vagina are pretty much the same cells as those that line the inside of our mouth. so it's not really infeasible. what are your views on this? will the doctor be able to manipulate the penile foreskin around the area of the vaginal opening (or where it would be) and manipulate the scrotum to accurately form a labia majora?"

3ac8vf,6792,Anxiety,1434667548,Noise Anxiety - stuck living in flats,"My situation is really complicated and it might not be so simple as noise anxiety. How do I start... I'll just say how I'm feeling right now. I feel like I'm trapped and will never be able to find a place to live where there isn't constant noise and vibrations. I'm a single girl without a paying job so I can't afford to rent privately and have been given a council flat. The first flat i was given was really bad. it was in a converted house and the floorboards were made from fibreboard and the noise was terrible. I had to be on SSRI's to stop myself from jumping off a bridge. Eventually I managed to arrange a move from there to this flat. I'm on the top floor in a block of flats. I thought it would be a lot better because no noise from above. It is better, a lot better, but I'm still fretting over it. The tenant below me closes his doors without turning the handle so there is a heck of a clatter. If you can believe it, he walks so heavily I can actually feel his footsteps. from the floor below. Then there is some other noise coming from somewhere else in the building. I'm not sure where it comes from but sometimes there is this almighty bang. Sometimes I can tell where it is coming from, it's somebody slamming their front door really loud so it echoes through the inner corridor. other times it could be the ground floor below me, 2 floors down... no idea what he could be doing to make such a bang. I have tried playing loud music to distract myself and so I won't notice.  there are times when I'm busy doing something and don't notice. there are times I can't help but notice and it makes me feel so anxious and trapped and I feel like I can't do anything. side issues... I'm on ESA, that is a kind of benefit for sick people. I went on it because of anxiety. the anxiety was partly caused by noise and partly caused by stress of looking for a job and the job centre system. I'm dyslexic so I have trouble with most things and the job centre system is becoming more and more tough and it's making me panic right now just thinking about it. When I went onto ESA I decided to work on my video game development skills in order to actually get into work and come off benefits. It's tough though because of the stress and anxiety. The way I see it, if I can get on with it and learn what i need to know and make my first game, I can make money and move to wherever I want. but as long as I'm living in this environment, I'm finding it hard to be able to get my head down to work. vicious circle.. add to this that I am actually inter-sex and am undergoing a transition from a wrongly assigned birth gender. which involves hormone replacement therapy bringing on a second puberty.  and self loathing that comes from my body being messed up. so there is a lot going on...just a while ago this evening after hearing the 8th bang this evening and feeling the rumbling footsteps of my downstairs neighbour.. I'm feeling a little desperate. for the first time in a long while I am having thoughts of suicide. I am even having thoughts of self harm which i have never had. I am feeling like pulling my hair out, or digging a knife into my arm etc.  I don't want to go onto more medication, I want to try and figure out what I can do. sorry for lots of writing and thank you for reading if you read it all."

ilfsb,7185,nosleep,1310278279,Freaking RIGHT THE FUCK OUT,"AFTER you read this, my aftermath is here: _PERSON_, I've NEVER posted on /r/nosleep before, and today honestly was my first day EVER on it, but the shit that literally happened to me just SECONDS ago isn't cool. Now, we already have an established ghost in the house. It follows us everywhere from house to house. I'm not one of those tweakers that hear a mouse in the attic and instantly assume its a ghost either. No; this ghost is the ghost of my step-mom's late father. Now, normally he just does things to let us know he's here: Knocking a DVD off the rack, swinging wind chimes that we have inside the house (for only god knows why) when there's absolutely no wind inside. Normally its more of a ""Hey, whats going on"" type thing not a ""I'M GOING TO RAPE YOU"" type thing. Normally that's all fine and dandy, but what just happened to me is WAY out of norm. Now, we live out in the sticks, and whoever put our house together did a really shitty job. So normally things that happen that are unusual are well, for lack of a better term, usual. _PERSON_ ceiling when the wind picks up, echoing chimney when it rains hard, and the occasional power outage is all normal stuff. None of it really phased me till what just happened.I know, I know, I've been beating around the bush and probably lost a lot of my readers by all this needless exposition but I'm trying to help you guys realize why I felt this was out of the ordinary. So I was sleeping in dad's big lazy chair wrapped up in a blanket oh so nicely and he and my step mom went downstairs to sleep. I was upstairs alone, this isn't something so unusual to me, and dad is a mild insomniac so I expected him to come upstairs and join me in 2 hours or so. Things didn't seem so spooky till My step mom left. That's when things started freaking me out. I heard a low, low growl. Like; not human, not animal, and definitely NOT happy. I slowly opened my eyes put on my glasses and looked around. At first I thought: ""Must be the base or something downstairs or my imagination from /r/nosleep today"" and tried to return to sleep. The thing is, I heard the growl again. It was impairing my sleep so I went downstairs to ask them to turn it down; that's what I realized that their T.V, was off. I went back upstairs and thought to myself its all in my imagination. I mean, I'm a 15 year old who's afraid of the dark and freaks out over stupid things, its time for me to man up and get over it, right? So anyway, there I was, wrapped up in my blanket like a little cocoon trying to sleep the bad things away when the growling came back. It didn't exactly sound like it was coming from anywhere. I have a good sense of where I'm hearing things from so normally I can mentally pinpoint where a sound comes from in the house. So I stayed silent, and listened. I only heard two things, my heart beat, and that growling. The issue is: The growling was coming from everywhere. It was either right next to me, or right above me. I flung open my blanket and looked around. Nothing, No one. I sighed and called myself an idiot and tried to go back to sleep, but that's when I heard the creaking.Like I said before, _PERSON_ isn't too uncommon in this house. The floor's made of wood so it generally creaks quite a lot. The thing is; I don't remember ever hearing cabinets creak in the house before, not like this. I look up and they're slowly swinging open and closed, not exactly hard, but not soft. I softly smirked and passed it off as our ghost and tried to go back to sleep actually feeling safer knowing he was around. That's when they started slamming open and closed, like someone was trying to break them off the hinges. I looked and saw that they were, in fact, slamming open and closed. That's when full fledged pussy mode engaged and I nope'd it all the way downstairs, where my room is. As I opened the door at the base of the stairs to enter our basement, I saw a shadow. It wasn't human, wasn't animal. It was indescribable past what you would think slender man would look like if he was real. Now, I'm not saying slender man IS real, but that's the best reference I can make to what it looked like. _PERSON_, skinny, dark, I swear I saw a couple tentacles breaking off from it. I swear, I'm never sleeping upstairs unless I have our double barreled 12 gauge shot gun nearby. The sad thing is: It WAS nearby till dad took it downstairs with him when he went to sleep. I don't know what's up there, but its not our friendly ghost, and I'm seriously hoping it stays up there. This is my first ever post on /r/nosleep, I'm hoping it entertained SOMEONE cause I'm scared to death right now. EDIT: I just heard a car door close outside, I'm seriously hoping its my step-uncle but if I don't hear the internal doors open, SOON, then I'm gonna go see what the HELL is going on.EDIT _PERSON_ 2: I'm hearing shuffling outside my door. I'm not seeing shadows, just shuffling. The issue with this is: I never heard someone enter the house. And dad and my step-mom have NO REASON to be shuffling outside my door.EDIT _PERSON_ 3: Tonight's creepiness: _URL_"
ilvo3,7185,nosleep,1310335695,Freaking RIGHT THE FUCK OUT: Aftermath,"If this is your first time reading this and you didn't read my craziness last night, the story is here: _URL_ Its highly recommended you read that one first. Also read the comments, a huge block of text in the comments will be an additive to the story cause I didn't want to make a new thread.So, I have to say a HUGE thank you to any and all redditors that were posting me (no matter how dumb) and keeping me awake throughout the night. Also I'll be posting more stories if anything else is to occur. Anyway, this is what happened after I finally left my safe place:I walked out of my room into the pre-described laundry room and saw that the door was not only ajar again, but WIDER this time. So of course my reaction, again, was ""fuck, this,"" and I nope'd it all the way back to my room again. So there I sat for a few minutes. If you were reading the comments you would know that if I leaned back just a tiny tiny bit I'd feel a temperature drop of at least 10 degrees. Also the ghost was confirmed to be in my room when my magazine, which was in my closet, ended up on my desk with me. I believe this irritated the ghost because it's name was ""My first Exorcism,"" and I had been talking about getting Exorcised since stuff started getting especially freaky. Also, when I turned my head really fast I'd see a shadowy figure run off to behind me. On top of that I saw its reflection, very vaguely, behind me in my laptop's monitor. So yeah, 1:30 AM to 4:00 AM was a bit of fresh hell for me. Anyway, at about 4:02 AM I got the nerve worked back into me by my real life buddy _PERSON_ telling me: ""If it was gonna do something to you, it would have done it by now."" After mulling this around in my head for a good ten minutes I decided he was right. I steeled my nerves, grew a pair, put on my big boy undies, and walked out. I walked up the stairs very cautiously listening closely for any sort of a growl, or even a squeak. I also kept my eyes fixed on the slightly illuminated floor in front of me for any sort of irregular shadow. To my relief nothing unusual happened. I started to get that creepy itchy feeling again (also described in my comments) and booked it for the kitchen light. As I grabbed the switch to flip the light I saw a figure in the chair I was sleeping in. This situation just screamed nope to me, but I was determined to face whatever this thing was. I prepared a fig hand, and flipped the switch.To my relief it was my father sleeping in the chair. I smiled, seeing a human being calmed me greatly. Also, the birds were starting to chirp outside, so dawn was close upon me. I walked over to our movie wrack, grabbed ""_PERSON_ in real life"" put it in the PS3 and started watching it. At about 4:30 AM I went to sleep. So that's my story for now. If anything happens I'll keep you posted. Thanks for your support /r/nosleep!Tonight's creepiness is here: _URL_"
im92b,7185,nosleep,1310370967,Night two of freaking RIGHT THE FUCK OUT,"Ok, so anyone who's been following me and wanted an update; here it is.So I've been sitting in my room since 10:00 PM waiting for midnight cause that's when things happened last night. My room isn't the biggest room ever. You open my door and you see a little book shelf. filled to the brim with books. You take a left and you see black curtains, that lead to my ghetto closet. Its basically a space with a rack for hanging things, and then a dresser. It has a little space above it as well where various items of mine are stored. Among which one was my magazine, the one named ""My first Exorcism."" You take a right and you can see my T.V. my now torn up chair from Deamo. On the wall to your left where my T.V. is there is two little cabinets upon which one of them has all my sonic affiliated stuffed animals (I'm 15 and not afraid to admit I have them). If you turn completely around you see my loft-style bed with a desk connected to the bottom of it. That's where I'm sitting right now. Now by the time 11 rolled around my friend (a fellow redditor) and I were joking about it being a succubus. I remembered how strange things had happened to me before when I lived in a different house. My T.V. stand is wooden and has two doors that open up to where the T.V. sits. I've had those slam shut on me before while watching it. I usually passed it off as a gust of wind cause my window was usually opened. One thing I never thought of though, was the fact that my window opens on the OPPOSITE side of where it would have to open to blow the door to my T.V. stand. This thoroughly freaked me out having forgotten these things. Anyway, we were joking about such things when I felt the temperature start to drop in my room around 11:30. This was a bad sign, but I ignored it. I continued talking with him and joking about ""her"" in the room with me when I got an idea. To the left of me on my desk was a big empty cup. I decided that if this thing could talk to me, I'd be able to see it vibrate thought the water. I mulled the idea over a bit but while I was something different happened.I had been listening to my favorite Japanese band because their music always kept me calm. That's when my perfectly good MP3's started to turn to all static. Pure static. Of course this scared me, but I wasn't gonna do anything to aggravate ""her."" That's when I decided I was gonna do my idea. I got up, grabbed the cup and headed for my door. When opening it I noticed something strange. It was harder to open, like someone was pushing on it. Maybe with only 1 hand, but pushing never-the-less. I eventually won the struggle and staggered a minute after the door opened. I walked into the bathroom, not daring to go upstairs after all the occurrences happening last night and poured a big glass of water. I walked back into my room, turned my music off, and looked at the glass. I spoke calmly to it.""Is someone here?"" I asked it. The glass didn't vibrate like I expected, instead the water in it started to spin. I asked again, a bit more stern. ""Is anyone *here*?"" The water started to spin faster. That's when I thought about doing the polite thing instead of freaking out. ""Stop spinning, please?"" I asked it, and just like that, the water stopped spinning. I smirked, I thought I was soo smart. Till the water started shaking.I looked at it horizontally. It looked perfectly still, but when I raised my head and looked at it at an angle, it was shaking. I almost payed this no mind till my music started to change, again. Now this band was 100% Japanese. They didn't have *ANY* English words in them. As my new song came on I heard a voice in the background. I've heard this song before, but never heard that. She sounded to be 18-20 years old. I couldn't hear exactly what she was saying, but I did hear the word ""You"" thrown around a lot in it. The song changed, the talking stopped.My friend, being the joker he was after hearing all this, said to me. ""Ask her if she has spirit STD's."" Of course, being the immature ass I am I laughed at it. That's when my cup started to vibrate again. I looked at it and I just felt like whatever is in here with me was telling him to shut his face. So I told him just that, to stop. Now that's where I was gonna end it, if something didn't happen the second I started writing this post: I started to get light headed. That itchy crawly feeling from last night came back, and I feel sick to my stomach. Most of all though, I'm light headed. This has NEVER happened to me before. I have a pounding head ache and a light-headed feeling. Even now I head a sound of high frequency shoot from my music that I've never heard before. I've been listening to the albums I have from this band for several months now, I would have heard these things.I don't know who or **what** is in my room, but it's here with me... She's here with me...EDIT: Ok, you all probably don't want to know this BUUUUUT There is something else that I feel is kinda significant. Once I hit the ripe age of hitting puberty (so 9ish) I started having visions of this 18-20 year old woman performing sexual acts on my body. Relevant? You tell me in the comments.EDIT M.K. 2: My friend (A different one from the one making jokes about ghost STD's) Brought to my attention that I was seeing her reflection in my monitor screen last night. I only ever saw her hair but it does, in fact, match up with the blonde hair of my visionary woman. I don't like that match up... I really don't..."
imazd,7185,nosleep,1310379420,The (underground),"Don't bother reading this, the full stories are here: redd.it/imldoSo I know I've been posting a lot about the haunting going on around me right now. I can feel her watching me right now, and I see her reflection in my monitor but she's calmed down. For those not privy to my haunting here's a link to the first time it ever happened to me (last night): redd.it/ilfsb .Anyway, I wanted to post about another strange thing that has happened to me, and wanted to know if it's ever happened to anyone else before. I don't want to say I see *spirits* themselves, but I will say I've seen, for lack of a better term, another **realm**. I aptly named it ""The *underground*."" In short, we have our realm; The real ground, and then you have the spirit's realm, the underground. I want to say its happened about four times, but I don't honestly remember any of the times clearly. My family has saw it happen to me, but weren't to concerned. I was always talking to my ""Imaginary friend"" when I was young, so they figured that's what I was doing.The first time it ever happened I want to say I was 7 but I might have been 8 or 9. My parents had split up when I was young, so I made an imaginary friend to deal with the space left in my life where my dad (who I live with now) was after mom won the custody battle. I don't know now if he was an imaginary friend or not, but after that day I figure he wasn't.It started out like any normal day, wake up go to eat breakfast. It was Saturday, so I had no where to be. I poured myself a bowl of cereal and sat down at the table. That's when, without my permission, my head locked. I couldn't move it, at all. Everything changed, I got tunnel vision and after everything sucked back into reality I was able to look around again but everything was... different. The atmosphere felt... heavier. I got up from the table and started walking around in our kitchen. That's where I saw my imaginary friend, his name was Shadow. I started talking to him, asking how is day at work was and everything, when I saw *another* person behind him. I asked who that was and he stepped aside to reveal a child about my age. The child had black hair, straight. It was long enough to cover one eye. The child smiled at me and said his name was _PERSON_. Shadow walked off and we started talking. After maybe 2 minutes I felt light headed and closed my eyes and lied onto my back. When I opened my eyes I felt like I was back home. I looked around and _PERSON_ and Shadow were gone. I got up, went back into the dining room and saw my mom there. She looked a bit worried but semi-calmly asked me ""Have fun with _PERSON_, son?"" I gleefully smiled and nodded before sitting down and started eating my cereal.My mom asked me if my eyes were ok. I told her they were fine and asked her why she asked. She told me they were big and wide, kinda like if they were dilated at the eye doctors. I told her they were fine, got up and grabbed a hand held mirror and checked out my eyes to make sure. I smiled at her and said ""see?"" I went about my day like nothing had happened. If this gets good enough responses I'll post my next experience with the ""Underground""EDIT: I should probably also note that colors when witnessing the underground were more monochromatic. They were there, just less vibrant."
imldo,7185,nosleep,1310407158,The (Underground) [All four experiences],"I saw a post this morning that basically said how much people hated having a story broken up into multiple pieces just for the sole purpose of attention whoring. I realized that... these people are right. So I've decided to go ahead and depict all four of my encounters with ""The underground"" no matter how much people like or don't like it. I'm too lazy to retype up everything that happened the first time though, so I'm just gonna copy paste. Experience one:I don't want to say I see spirits themselves, but I will say I've seen, for lack of a better term, another realm. I aptly named it ""The underground."" In short, we have our realm; The real ground, and then you have the spirit's realm, the underground.I want to say its happened about four times, but I don't honestly remember any of the times clearly.

I smiled at her and said ""see?"" I went about my day like nothing had happened.I should probably also note that colors when witnessing the underground were more monochromatic. They were there, just less vibrant. Also Shadow was usually a wispy figure to me, but when witnessing the underground he was real to me as my mother was moments later.On top of this I wasn't able to see her. She was able to get close enough to me to see my pupils, but I never once saw her during the experience.Experience 2:By this time I was about 10 years old. I had forgotten about my first experience and was living my life normally. We lived in an apartment at this time. It wasn't too big of a place. It was two bedroom two bathroom. In mom's room was her connecting bathroom, she always had one, and then across the hall was my bathroom.I had just gotten home from school (I rode the bus) and I walked into the kitchen for an after-school snack. I grabbed a banana and planted myself in front of our big-ass T.V. After a while I started playing _PERSON_ and Daxter out of pure boredom with the T.V. I was watching. That's when my head locked again.I don't know how long it was locked, but it locked some time while I was playing it. I was far enough back from the T.V. that I never really needed to turn my head, so I didn't notice it. I only noticed it when mom called my name and I tried to turn my head to see her. I got up quickly and turned my body toward her bedroom door panicking a little. Then my tunnel vision came back and I fell back onto my rear with fear.When I finally opened my eyes and could turn my head again I saw that everything was more dull again. The difference this time was that the walls around me seemed to be leaning in toward me. No matter where I went I could see this. My bedroom, my bathroom, my living room. I didn't dare go into my mom's room for fear of what might have happened to her.Then the door opened, or so I thought. I swung my body around to see who was there and it was none other than Shadow. I thought I had outgrew him, so this surprised me. Shadow was a tall man, in a fine black suit. He had straight black slicked back hair and always carried around his brief case. When I say tall I mean he had to duck down underneath doorways to get inside. I suppose he had gotten taller by then though, to keep my head at how far up it needed to be to see his face. His skin was pale white compared to his black suit.He walked into the house very nonchalant like and opened the fridge. I was still a bit speechless as to why he was here. I shouted out ""Moooom! Shadow's here I'm gonna go play outside!"" The playground in our apartment complex was seen just outside my mom's bedroom window so she would let me go outside to play on the swings and stuff. I turned and ran outside as fast as I could leaving Shadow where he was. Once I saw the playground, I regret my decision. The playground was filled with children. Most of them in all white clothing with little red splotches on them. Almost immediately they were all locking eyes with me. Three were spinning on the carousel, two on the two swings, and one on the slide sliding down at me.I backed up against the side wall of the apartment complex and just stared at them. They stared back, with soft, almost kind smiles. Then one started walking toward me. ""Whats wrong mister?"" He asked kindly. I closed my eyes, I didn't want to believe it, I couldn't believe it. I shook my head and when I opened my eyes they were gone... all of them. I went back upstairs (I lived on the second story) and into my house where I saw a slightly worried mother once more. ""Honey... I thought you outgrew shadow"" She said to me in a concerned tone. ""I thought so too mom, but he was here a minute ago,"" I responded going about my business like I wasn't scared at all. ""What did you go into the fridge for dear?"" She asked me. ""That wasn't me mom, it was shadow, duh"" I responded very matter-of-fact like. It didn't hit me till my third experience that when shadow opened the fridge, mom heard it.Experience 3:I was 12 now, and old enough to start researching what I had now named ""The underground."" Through hours of pointless searching I found no answer or any story even slightly relating to the phenomenon that I was experiencing. It was unexplainable, unreasonable, and unreal. It was a warm spring Sunday morning when I started to research again. I clicked a link, skimmed the page, nothing. Google truly was useless to me in those days. That's when I got bored and started spinning in my chair. My mother always told me not to, but I never listened. Of course, If I had I might have avoided what happened next. The wheel on the chair snapped and the entire chair toppled over onto its back. My eyes were closed for protective reasons and as a natural reaction, but when I opened them I was seeing the underground again.Again, the first being I saw was shadow, standing over me. He extended one of his long lanky arms to me and asked me if I was ok. I took his hand and got up, but that's when I realized that was the first time I ever *heard* shadow speak. Normally He was silent, never said anything, this was the first time I heard him say anything. His voice was low and manly but not bodyguard deep. Of course by this I was scared so I turned tail and ran back to my room. I wrapped myself up in my favorite blanket and shook with fear for a good three minutes. I then heard a child's voice from behind me. ""Don't be afraid, mister."" It said. I turned around and to the right of me a bit and saw a child standing in the corner of the room. I just stared, too afraid to speak, nearly on the verge of tears. ""Mommy will be here soon to take me away, it was fun talking to you mister."" The child spoke calmly and then smiled at me again. That's when A woman in her mid thirties came walking *through* my wall and stood next to the boy. *THROUGH* the damn wall! We lived on the second story! On top of that, I realized that during my second experience I never really saw the door open and closed, only thought I heard it. I wondered if shadow walked through my door just as the woman had. I covered my head in my blanket and lied there for a good 10 minutes before I uncovered myself to see everything back to normal again.Experience 4, last experience:I was about 14 now and had been having nightmares about my third experience since it happened. None of the beings I saw were intentionally frightening, but when you see the laws of physics break right before your very eyes you tend to freak out.This time I wasn't at home, I was at a friends house. He and I were playing games and it was close to midnight. His mother came in and told us it was time to go to bed, so I curled into my sleeping bag and we turned out the lights and tried to sleep.When I woke up that night I didn't realize I was seeing the underground again, it was too dark for me to see the tell-tale signs. I got up and shuffled my way to the bathroom. I walked in and closed the door before turning on the lights, as I usually did. I then turned on the lights and didn't notice anything out of norm. I wasn't looking for the signs, so I didn't see them. I did my business and was washing my hands when I looked down to focus on them. Nothing seemed different and I continued washing them until I looked back up at my reflection in the mirror.Right there standing in the corner of the bathroom was Shadow. Except this time he was... smiling. Not a haha that joke's funny or I'm genuinely happy smile either. It was a crazy smile. One you think the _PERSON_ from Batman would have. I looked him in the eye and calmly told him ""you're not real."" To that he laughed. He reached forward and placed a hand on my shoulder, still having that crazy smile. I jumped and turned to look at him, this being my first time ever feeling his touch. When I turned he was gone. I sighed thinking it was all my imagination until I heard three words in my ear whispered that I will never forget. ""Don't forget me."" It was shadow's voice, no doubt about it. I told myself I was just being silly and went back and crawled into bed. I refused to think about what had just happened to me or talk about it to anyone that day.This was my experience, tell me if you've ever experienced something similar or have any ideas what the hell was happening to me."
in7h4,7185,nosleep,1310454733,Night three of freaking RIGHT THE FUCK OUT,"Ok, so I'm gonna continue posting on my haunting because after two posts no one seems uninterested. For those just tuning in link to the first one is here: redd.it/ilfsb . That is when this all started.So tonight dad was throwing a party, so I was trying to keep my mind off of my haunting as the hour of 11 PM rolled around. I've learned tonight that she doesn't like me outside, at all. Now, everyone *except me* (being only 15) was drunk off their ass, so even IF she could mess with me no one would really notice it.Anyway, the way I came to the conclusion of her not being able to mess with me while outside is that while we were all sitting around the camp fire at about... 11:15 I started to notice something strange with the bathroom. The light was flickering on and off. The window to the bathroom was right in my line of sight, so unless I was facing away from the house I wouldn't have been able to not see it. I figured it was one of the kids in the house playing around and I got up to tell them to stop. When I got inside though, all the kids were in the living room. Now, I figured they saw me coming and ran, but that wasn't the case. When I asked who used the bathroom last, no one owned up to it. Now, I would have thought they were lying, if at that moment I realized they were watching a movie, and had been for quite some time. If one had run from the bathroom back into the living room, I would have noticed. All the adults were outside as well, so everyone was accounted for.I quickly went downstairs to go talk to my friend about it, when the next creepy thing of tonight happened. Deamo, our pit bull, has what we call the ""Deamo nest."" Its an opened suitcase with blankets and stuff in that he lies in when we let him out of his kennel and into the laundry room. He lifted his head to look at me as usual and I gave him a friendly smile. Then he lowered his ears and growled. He had never done this to me before, we have had him since he was a puppy and he is nine years old now. It was then that I noticed Deamo wasn't looking at me, he was looking at *behind me.* I quickly flipped a 180 and saw no one behind me. My nope radar was going off like a fucking firework at the fourth of July. I turned and ran into my bedroom as quickly as possible. When I went to slam the door behind me it felt as if someone was pushing on the other side trying to stop me from closing it at all. Eventually I won the fight and shut it. I slowly backed up and got into my chair. Things started to escalate at this point.My friend, (the one who made a joke about STD's) being the joker he is said Hi to her. I already knew she wasn't too happy about him, but this put the icing on the cake of fear that I had boiling inside of me. After He said Hi, a empty bottle of root beer that I had been drinking earlier today flew across my computer screen. By this time I was freaking out. I was beyond the point of screaming, I was at the point where you're so scared that the only sound in the room was you shitting enough bricks to build the empire state building. I told my friend what she was doing, and then he said ""Well, I don't know about you, but right now she's being a real **BITCH**."" (Yeah, thanks guy, i liked my desk lamp) To which she shattered the light inside one of my two desk lamps sitting on my desk. I can't make this stuff up! Of course, my friend the fucking GENIUS he is decides he wants to talk to her. So he starts talking to her like I wasn't there at all and after I read what he said I clicked the screen away. That's when my keys started pushing themselves. I sat there and watched as they pushed themselves down.After seeing this, I told my friend, who told me immediately to just sit back and let her do the typing. I too, was curious at what she had to say. She kept it short and sweet, though her slowly pushing down the buttons felt like she was taking an eternity to type out two simple words: ""Fuck you."" By this time I've shit enough bricks to build a second planet AND The rocket ship needed to fly away to the magical far away place where this shit NEVER HAPPENS TO ANYONE.I'm getting that light headed feeling again. I really don't think she likes me sharing my story.I think its time I looked into Exorcisms. DISCLAIMER: My friend who was talking to her isn't a bad guy. He just thought it was all in my head till things like this started happening. EDIT: I posted the conversation between my friend and her at the bottom in the comments, check it out."
io787,7185,nosleep,1310537666,Live streaming of freaking RIGHT THE FUCK OUT,
ioayb,7185,nosleep,1310550250,Night four of freaking RIGHT THE FUCK OUT,"So I know a great deal of redditors that have been following my haunting didn't go to the live streaming. So I'm making a follow up post to fill in those unlucky enough to not experience the creepy with me. So as expected this all started at about 11:30 PM. It started out with my dog _PERSON_ growing at a corner of my room. No one really heard it but I did, he eventually calmed down and went to sleep on my chair that he absolutely destroyed. That's when, from that exact corner, my fellow redditors that attended my live streaming saw a darkness coming from where _PERSON_ growled.Of course, I couldn't see it physically, but when I looked at the camera feedback, it was, in fact, there. Of course, this scared me a bit. I really couldn't put my finger on it, but I didn't feel good about the darkness. I felt like _PERSON_ was mad at me. After much debate my fellow redditors decided that my ghost's name was _PERSON_. Anyway, amongst the shadow and the growling they saw a black orb sitting behind me. This I didn't see, but that wasn't where the night of craziness ended. Of course by this time they've seen enough to scare enough piss out of me to drown a horse so I had to get up and pee. Then another creepy thing happened:When I returned, the sound level that my mics registered at was lowered. So everyone heard me quieter. Of course, I was out of the room, so no possible way could I have faked this. This happened on multiple occasions. I would get up to use the restroom and something would happen. On one specific occasion when I left they heard some sort of scream while I was gone. Of course, this wasn't where my creepy night ended.Things started to get calm after that, we had casual chats. Till she started saying ""Hes mine"" over my computer again. I started to get splitting headaches by then as well. But that was near the end of the night, before that though I have a decorative knife sitting on my desk. Everyone watched as I got up and placed it in my closet. Later on, after my second round of having the piss scared out of me, it was back on my desk. Just the knife though, the sheath was still in my closet. I got up and showed everyone that it was still in my closet. Back to the headaches. Things started getting really serious at that point. We all watched as one of my lights started to flicker, then eventually went out. Then my second light did the same. I sat back onto the arm of my chair with genuine fear plastered across my face. Anyone watching can vouch for that.Eventually _PERSON_ calmed down. We had someone in the live chat room with the username _PERSON_, but we all figure that was a troll of some sort. Sadly, my splitting headache refused to let up. One one account one of the watchers saw as a poster on my wall seemingly moved, but no one could concur with that one. Everything seemed really creepy.I eventually found out that _PERSON_ had unplugged my lights, after plugging them back in I sat down again and talked with them trying to calm myself. Some of my watchers started proclaiming love to _PERSON_ and such, I told them it wasn't funny but they were trying to keep me calm and keep the mood lightened. Eventually my lights were knocked out again and my splitting headache got even worse.After minutes of sitting there, at around 1:12 AM I passed out from the pain of my headache in front off all of my watchers. I woke up maybe a minute later and still had the headache, but I pressed on till 1:30 when she finally calmed down and disappeared.Tomorrow I'm gonna try and go into the underground and meet _PERSON_. If I do so pray for me guys."
ip43b,7185,nosleep,1310615819,Successfully willed myself into the (Underground),"So, I've been talking with fellow redditors about going INTO the ""underground"" out of pure will. For those of you who do not know the underground, a link to my previous four stories is here: redd.it/imldo . For those of you who refuse to read that wall of text a quick summary from the text is this: I don't want to say I see spirits themselves, but I will say I've seen, for lack of a better term, another realm. I aptly named it ""The underground."" In short, we have our realm; The real ground, and then you have the spirit's realm, the underground.Anyway, here's how my experience went:I sat upstairs in my living room where I thought nothing could get me immediately. I had already prepared myself with my decorated, but still sharp, knife. A notebook and a fully sharpened pencil, and a back-up pen. I also had my favorite sonic stuffed animal, as suggested by a fellow redditor, as a link back to the real ground. I sat down and I closed my eyes tight. Thinking with every fiber of my being about how the underground looked. How it felt. I focused everything I could on thinking about the underground and how I felt inside of it. I started to hear a chuckling. I *Know* no one else was in the house with me. So of course I opened my eyes and started to look around.I had made it into the underground. I know that much for certain. When I scanned outside the window all the trees were dead and wilting. The atmosphere had that heavy feeling as well. The colors were dull again also. I knew without a doubt I was in the underground. I knew that I had done it. This is where the hell of my life for the next three hours begun.I finally found the source of the chuckling and it was none other than shadow. Sitting in the comfy chair that I had been sleeping in when night one of my haunting begun. I opened up my journal and begun writing down everything about the underground that I could see. Shadow stood up, gracefully walked over to me, and swatted the journal out of my hands. I looked up at him and reached into my pocket, Grabbing my knife as I stared into his cold gray dead eyes. ""You think I bring you here for nothing?"" He continued his chuckle after speaking to me in his deep hollow voice. ""I'm astounded that you actually went through with ignoring our _PERSON_ annual ritual and went ahead and tried to get here yourself."" He turned around and sat back into the chair, he lifted up one lanky leg and placed it over his knee. ""You're *Mortal* O'dell. But I will give you the fact that you had enough heart and enough will to make it in here."" He gave an amused smile as his dark empty eyes widened. ""Watch your back,"" He whispered before completely disappearing. I fell backwards after his disappearance and quickly grabbed my journal, furiously writing down everything that he said while it was still fresh in my mind. I grabbed my stuffed animal and started to explore the house. I walked into the kitchen and turned on the faucet. Nothing seemed out of order about the water so I grabbed a cup and begun to drink it. The water cooled my nerves and reminded me of the original plan. To talk to _PERSON_. I steeled my nerves and started to walk downstairs. Once in the laundry room I felt something... off. Like something was watching me. I passed it off as general paranoia that followed me through the underground and slowly opened the door to my room. Clutching my knife tightly in preparation for the worst.There she sat, in the torn tatters of my ruined chair like it was her throne. Her golden locks reached down to her shoulders and her eyes were shimmering blue. She sat there smirking before standing after seeing me. She was wearing a white sundress. She looked just like she sounded, 18 to 20 years old. Her voice flowed like the wind as she spoke to me. ""I've been expecting you"" she said in a soft voice. I didn't let my guard down, I refused to. I know what she is capable of and looked her in the eye without fear. ""What do you want with me."" I asked her, in a demanding manner. ""You're mine now."" She responded with a smile lowering her head a bit. ""Come, join me."" she added sitting back down in the chair. I didn't move, even though for some reason every fiber of my being screamed for me to walk toward her. ""I'm not yours. What do you want with me."" I demanded again. She frowned and sighed. ""I want your love... and I will do anything to get it."" She whispered back. I stared at her, awestruck. Sadly, I had already been planning to go out with a girl that I've been in love with for years, and she has felt the same. So this thing with _PERSON_ never would have worked.""I _PERSON_ to someone else."" I told her calmly, clutching my knife tighter just in case she reacted violently. Her soft supple face turned into a scowl that would cause even the manliest man to whimper. ""You are **MINE**!"" She exclaimed standing up and started walking toward me. I pulled my knife from its sheath and looked up at her holding it up in preparation to stab. ""I don't want to hurt you"" I told her calmly. She just laughed. She took my knife from me and stabbed it into my wall glaring at me once more. I tried to push her away but she placed one of her hands onto my forehead and slammed the back of my head as hard as she could into my wall. I turned and ran slamming my door behind me.I ran into the bathroom and furiously wrote down again everything I saw and heard into almost undecipherable scribbles. I was scared shitless. I grabbed my sonic plushie and closed my eyes focusing everything I had on going back to the real ground. After that I assume I passed out. I woke up on the floor of the bathroom and looked around. Everything seemed normal.I walked back into my room and saw that _PERSON_ was gone, my knife was still stuck in the wall. After about a minute of pulling I got it out of the wall. My head still hurt like no other. Three hours had passed.I'm going to look into exorcisms immediately. I want _PERSON_ out, and I want her out now."
ipbxi,7185,SuicideWatch,1310640541,Teenage death-wish,"I'm pretty much the average teenager with average issues. I've come to a crossroad in my life where I just don't know what to do with myself. I've become almost afraid to wake up in the morning because of all the betrayal that has followed me through life. Almost everyone close to me has betrayed me at one point or another. Some of my closest friends that knew everything that there is to know about me have turned their back without a second thought. Then walked back into my life like nothing was wrong.This has caused me to become paranoid to near homeless person with tinfoil hat levels. Every day I wake up and I force a smile on my face because I know If I show one iota of depression they'll get mad at me. I live my life to please my friends, and in the process, I am not pleased.Then we come to the topic of a girl, I'll call her ""E."" I can't express my feeling for E. She's been in my life for 3 years and has drastically improved it, but not completely pulled me out of my dark hole. I live even more to make her happy. When she smiles I feel like I actually have a purpose. But when I'm not talking to her I feel that same emptiness that fills my life. Now we move onto family. I've lived with my father for about 3 months now, finally escaping the clutches of my emotionally abusing mother. This sounds like a good thing right? Wrong. No matter how hard I try I just don't seem to be the son my dad wants me to be. I can *never* please him. Thanks to emotional abuse from my mother its an internal battle just to tell my dad that I love him. Even though I could say it to E within an instant. In short, my life is a shithole of depression and I only accomplish digging myself deeper. I've tried multiple times to kill myself. My arms are a fucking road map of scars.... someone. Please help... tell me how to escape this horrible thing I call a life.I'll be answering questions in the comments if you even bother to ask one..."

They offered to have me e-published in a few months if I can write out a good fictional scary storyI can do it, the issue is, I don't have any idea what to write about. Help?"
itpkk,7185,nosleep,1311072496,The final night of freaking RIGHT THE FUCK OUT,"Ok, things have been pretty calm since my last post, but after tonight, I'm not risking my well-being anymore. Tonight started as normal. I could hear _PERSON_ sobbing in my closet as usual. Nothing really seemed out of norm, so I let my guard down. Mistake one.I was surfing the web, talking to buddies and such when I noticed a youtube link. It had my friend and romantic interest's name on it. Of course, after seeing this I clicked the link. Mistake two.There she was, singing. Her voice was like an angel's. I felt her eyes on me, _PERSON_'s, I didn't think too much on it, I was too absorbed in Elaine's singing. I should have noticed and cut off the youtube link. I was too enthralled. I sat back and smiled continuing to watch Elaine sing and do her cute little dance.My laptop slammed shut.I've had problems with old laptops, their joints would get old and hard to keep the head up. But this _PERSON_ is new, so its joints worked fine. I felt something on me, like someone was pushing in my chest hard. I found it hard to breath. I knew it was _PERSON_. I knew it. She pulled me from my stool and shoved me into my chair. I felt a hand on my neck, but she wasn't squeezing. I felt a sharp pain shoot up my arm. Horrible stinging pain that caused me to almost scream from pain. At this point I was scared shitless. Normally I shit bricks in this situation but there was too much fear to even do that. I look at my arm now as I type and I see large hard to see scars on my arm. I know I've never had these before, I've never had an injury to prompt one. _PERSON_ eventually let me go and the pain subsided, but I know why she did that. She wanted to remind me she was still there, and she wanted me. I need to kill _PERSON_ fast.I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I'm going to do it soon. I refuse to let this go on any longer."

Normally this would irritate me more than anything but... My stupid feelings for her and seeing her this way makes me get pulled back into that dark abysmal existence that she's currently in. We got into a fight today... a few minutes ago... and I said some things that I will regret forever but.. I just need a way to reach out to her... show her that she CAN be happy... show her that she might be able to find some sort of resolve in someone else or something else.Whenever we talk on the phone its almost like she never was depressed but its times when we can't reach each other that she gets really bad...

jc4wf,7185,nosleep,1312780952,It started up again /nosleep,"God I don't know what I'm doing right now. Every time I posted it just made shit worse but... I feel like I'm obligated over like, 5 posts that I was sharing.That's right /nosleep. Danaxeil is back and _PERSON_ is worse than ever.I told you all about how I'd try to return to the underground and face her but... after that day my family became horribly poor. So my dad and step-mom don't have the gas money to leave me alone for the day to do so. I'm not gonna risk having them see me in my half-conscious state of underground...ed...ness.Anyway. Since my last post shit has been horrible for me. On top of the fact that I get sick every other day, which is EXTREMELY unusual since I used to only get sick once or twice a year, I've been having these... thoughts...I don't know if it has to do with the fact that _PERSON_ touched me or something but I've been having thoughts that *Aren't mine.*I don't know how else to explain it. Even when I'm sick, life is pretty good for me. But every now and again I get this horrible thought of suicide. It's not like a want, its a NEED. I feel like I NEED to die. Like there's no other reasonable option in life than death. These come at the oddest times. Like when (Shamefully but truthfully) fapping or gaming. I know she's watching me right now, probably reading this. Probably why my headache is back.Weird things happen that others notice too.Like I'll be talking on the phone with friend and romantic interest (Everyone calls her Cakey) And she'll start hearing this static. But she swears to god that she hears a voice behind the static. I just bite my lip and say nothing, but I know that's a similar phenomenon that I heard when my MP3's turned to static and I heard a voice in my j-rock.My dad has started to notice things as well. He'll come into my room and look around before saying he swore he heard loud, LOUD crying. He says it sounded like A woman but I can't tell if he's being serious or just insulting me and saying I cry like a woman. I've been starting to have weird nightmares too. Normally I don't remember my dreams, but I've been having _PERSON_ realistic nightmares recently. The most memorable of which was one that Shadow himself was in.For those who don't know, Shadow was my ""Imaginary friend"" when I was a child and some say spirit guide now. I say creepizoid that is always around when I go into the underground. At least... for now.Anyway, back to the nightmare.I'm alone, or so I think, in a dark room. I can vaguely see the outlines of the walls and I look around frantically for some source of light. I'm about as easy to spook as a bunny rabbit so I'm clearly frightened by this point. Then a light flickers on in the middle of the room. No visible source, just a light. Shadow's standing there, his head bowed, his hands behind his back. He looks up at me gently with that crazy smile. He starts laughing. Bone chilling laughter. I'm frozen with fear, stuck watching the scene unfurl. He walks toward me and sneers out ""You fucked up now, Watch your back"" Before the light cuts out and he's gone. I wake up then, screaming and in a pool of my own sweat. I don't know what to do... With the parent's here I can't go into the underground and stop _PERSON_. And she only seems to get stronger with each passing day.At this point... I almost Accept my fate and wonder... who will break first... me or _PERSON_."
jdr6h,7185,nosleep,1312916000,So I had another creepy dream.,"This one was almost realistic... I knew posting here again would piss _PERSON_ off.The dream didn't relate to _PERSON_, it was shadow again, the words that he said still chill my bones. I can't seem to get over them... But now I get the feeling he *and* _PERSON_ are watching me. What he said was too creepy to be a coincidence. So here it goes nosleep. My nightmare.It was like the other reoccurring Shadow dream I've had, pitch blackness. Me already shitting bricks and trying to find a way to nope it the hell out of there when a light turns on and Shadow's there. This time he was... different. His eyes wider... his smile Scarier... His entire body contorted as he looked at me. He took a step toward me and his entire figure seemed to wiggle. He started laughing and stopped just before me. He turned around and leaned backwards so that his spine pretty much was flat and his face was upside down in front of mine. ""You're listening to the... fucking liars..."" He whispered before his spine snapped back upright. He shrugged his shoulders and started to walk away. ""You're gullible, I should have seen this coming."" He added, he started to tilt backwards again. This time he went till he was horizontal, then his spine made a horrendous snapping noise as he spun upright. So his legs were facing away, his spine tilted backwards at a 90 degree angle and then his spine snapped and tilted so that he was looking at me. His crazy smile was still there. ""You should listen to me... there's no one to trust in this world... You know that! You can't trust Cakey! You can't trust _PERSON_! You can't trust _PERSON_!"" He started to laugh again naming off some of my closest friends. ""You call Darrell your friend!? You already don't trust him! Now you're going to trust some... stupid people on the internet!?"" His laughs stopped and his smile turned to a scowl. His spine made another horrendous snapping noise as he spun around and faced me fully. He made a low growling noise and walked up till he was face to face with me (or as close as he could be being so tall). ""The only one you can trust as me... Don't forget that."" That was the end of the dream. I woke up and felt like my lungs had been crushed and I hadn't taken a breath in forever. I was sweating profusely and I couldn't stop shaking for hours.What do you guys think about Shadow now? I think he's no longer a creeper... but I'm doubting him being a spirit guide."

jmhr3,7185,nosleep,1313649190,Hearing noises,"So this is completely unrelated to my shadow/_PERSON_ chronicles, sorry to anyone who still reads those. Nothing really bump-in-the-night esque has happened with _PERSON_ recently, otherwise I'd post about her. Well, This might fall into that category, but I'm signing it off as not related because she hasn't messed with me before outside the house.So we live out in the woods, Literally, no matter where you turn outside our house there is woods. We have no neighbors except for a long car drive down our ""Drive way"" to get to a normal road and see ""Civilization,"" Which to us is a motel, a bar, and a Shell station. Then another good 15 minutes on the highway to actually reach civilization civilization. So, the first time we heard this.. noise was about 2-3 weeks before this stuff with _PERSON_ kicked off. I was out at the campground with my dad, tanya (my step mom) and about 5 of my brother's friends, also my two younger brothers. We were all having a good time, partying around the camp fire. One of us being a dip-shit and nearly lighting his shoe on fire from being too close. Another one of us shouldn't be allowed to reproduce because he somehow burned his entire knee on the fire and ""never stepped near it"" bullshit.Anyways, my father, step mother, and I all hear this woman scream. Maybe 100 yards away. It was a woman, there's no doubt in my mind. We all kinda looked around but only the three of us heard it. We kinda shot each other that ""What the fuck was that?"" look and I turned and distracted the boys. Dad discretely grabbed the shot gun (we always go out into the woods with protection) and turned on the radio (we had the truck with us) to make sure the boys didn't hear anything. My youngest brother wouldn't have been scared, probably interested. But my other young brother, about two years younger than me, is as easily frightened as I am. But I put on my awesome older brother face and kept everyone busy with stories and horrible singing. That night, I didn't sleep, We were all doing things boys do, and some things boys... don't do. It started with a pillow fight, but some how by the end of the night we were all dry humping each other. (As a bisexual male, and a top, I didn't enjoy being dry humped much &gt;.&gt;) Anyway, so that was the first time... then last night it got worse.My dad, step mom, and I were sleeping in the tent cause we thought it would be fun to do so. This is about... maybe a month later, so we had all forgotten it for the most part. Dad and I couldn't sleep (we're both insomniacs, I blame him) so we were awake bullshitting around but still lying down. _PERSON_ was out cold. Until, maybe, 50 feet away we hear a child scream. Not only was the scream terrifying, but the *way* it screamed. The scream wasn't a straight up ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" no, it was more like ""AAAAAAAAaaaaahhhh....AHHHHH....ahhh...."" We both shot up and looked at each other. Dad grabbed the shot gun and I grabbed the pistol. I'm not a great shot, but I swear to god if anything tried to get me I'd get it in the face (I work better under pressure). We agreed not to tell _PERSON_, because she also scares easy, but I still am unsettled by those noises. We're gonna go camping again tomorrow maybe. I'm bringing my trusty _PERSON_ and pistol. I'm not taking any chances with whats out there... whats getting closer to us..."

I put up barrier after barrier and they emotionally knock me down just to stab me one more time. Over the course of this year so far I've lost All but 5 of my friends. Had my heart smashed to pieces more times than I can count. Moved across the state. Realized I'm not good enough for my father, and now, I'm having my heart crushed again.I was stupid to believe her. Stupid to think that when she said ""I'll give you a chance soon"" That she was serious. She soon after told me that she still loved her ex, even though he didn't feel that way about her anymore. I supported her, played the nice guy, talked to her on the phone, and generally was there for her. Then, I asked her out, She said ""I dunno"" and we left it at that. I figured she wasn't ready.

My mother confirmed that I'm not crazy as well...So I was talking to her on the phone cause if I don't call her every week or so she'll stop paying for my phone. A fair deal, no? Anyway we stumbled upon the topic of the paranormal and she kinda got quiet. I described to her about _PERSON_, not exactly what she looked like, but that she was there and what she was doing and she stopped me. She decided to tell me something about my childhood. At first I didn't realize what she was talking about, till it all made sense.She told me that about a year after her and dad got a divorce, which was when I was 2, I was still in a crib because I refused to move to a small bed. I was a stubborn baby apparently. One night she heard me talking to someone. She distinctly remembers saying ""Hi Lady, whats your name? _PERSON_? That's a pretty name."" (Note, never ONCE did I mention the name ""_PERSON_"" when describing her to my mother) She burst into my room all concerned-mother like and looked over at me in the corner. There was a rocking chair in the corner of the room because that's where my mother rocked me when I Was younger and there sat a woman by her description, about 18-20 with blonde hair. Description ring any bells? By this time I was dead silent. She paused, I urged her to go on, I needed to know what had happened.She told me that the woman looked directly at her, with a scowl, before disappearing. She said after that I jumped and started crying. She walked in, picked me up, and asked me what was wrong, and she said and I quote: ""Then you said, 'the woman went away, it scared me' ""How long has _PERSON_ been tailing my life? I have a whole list of questions for the next time I go into the underground. And she WILL answer all of them."

He always grew taller as I grew taller so he'd always stay taller than me by a good length. I remember him being extremely pale and always wore a business suit. I remember him having a face, sadly, but he seemed to come and go when *he* wanted to, not when I imagined him. And, those several times that he's PULLED me into the underground, I've always seen him accompanied by children in white clothing. Like, starch white, sometimes with blood stains on them. They would be doing what children do, playing at the park in one instance. Now, I'm doubting if Shadow is really imaginary. If you've been delving into Nosleep and seeing my posts then you'd know how EVERY time I'm in the UG Shadow is there. I'm starting to consider him being Slenderman, though I've looked him dead in the eye and I'm not going stark-raving mad. No operator symbols. No memory lapses. Nothing. Is it possible Slenderman is my... or was my... friend?"

But now he's talking about becoming a fireman and moving her up to Boston with him (she prefers long distance relationships) and all this that and another and she's terrified. She cries on the phone with me all the time because she's so scared. And seeing her like that... knowing things would be different if she just went out with me stabs me in the chest so hard. I want her to be happy more than anything but sometimes I feel like I should be doing something better to help her out instead of just being so filled with envy and remorse.Then there's Elaine. I've known her just about a year longer than I have _PERSON_. She's Sixteen and gorgeous. She's pulled me from the pit of depression more times than I can count. I wouldn't be here to ask for another plea of help if it wasn't for her. The reason she depresses me is... I'm guilty about loving her too. I fell in love with her... basically when I first saw her. She's gorgeous, smart, funny, random, hyper. Everything she is, I love. There's not a damn thing in her I would change. I would kill myself willingly if it would make her smile... But she doesn't love me the same way. She loves me as her best friend. I think I'm her most important friend, but she probably doesn't gauge her friends. I try not to ... but I do anyways cause I'm a horrible person. Anyway... I'm guilty for loving her because she doesn't feel the same. And so I make her sad all the time because since she doesn't feel the same she feels like she's not good enough to make me happy. Its a cycle, her and I. She feels good when I feel good and tries to keep me feeling good. I feel good when she feels good and I try to keep her feeling good. When one of us is down, we both are. She's the only reason I've been alive this long...Then there's my dad. Last but not least. He's twenty years older than me. And... His reason for me being depressed is simple. He. Can't. Help. It kills him inside and it kills me inside because of it. I try so hard to be a good enough son for him. I try so hard to make him proud of me but when I take off my ""mask of happiness"" and show him how I'm really feeling he gets angry because he can't help me. He tries, god he tries. But he just can't, he never had these issues, he doesn't understand. So yeah... those are my three main things bringing me down. Also the fact that I'm physically unable to make myself happy. When I do, I feel vain. I feel selfish. I feel greedy and horrible and that all pulls me back down into depression...I have plenty of ways of offing myself... sometimes I feel like the world would be happier without my presence bringing them down... Please... convince me otherwise... I don't want to do it but I feel like its the only thing I can do to please everyone..."

m4fsp,7185,nosleep,1320726457,The final nail in the coffin.,"Well, this is it guys. I have my answers. _PERSON_'s gone. Shadow is... I think he's dead actually...So, Sorry for the wait. We hit rock bottom and lost our internet. You guys probably don't even remember me, its a dog eat dog world, and I was the latter. Anyways... I guess I'll start at the beginning of the end._PERSON_ and I got into a fight, before the family was gonna leave to go to a barbeque. I told him, eventually, screamed it really, to leave me the fuck alone. His response: ""You can stay home then."" It was perfect. Sadly I've had depression issues recently, and dad caught me trying to cut with my knife so he took it from me. This time, I was going in unarmed. I don't consider going into the Underground a psychic power... more of a curse. The land of the dead is filled with hatred and envy and I feel like I'm affected heavily by it every time I enter. I didn't care though._PERSON_ had started getting ballsy, she even flipped a spatula off the counter with my *dad watching it*. Turned him into a believer, though. Anyway, everyone left. I got my Journal out and sat on the autamin (I have no idea how to spell it, don't hate). I closed my eyes and did everything I did last time to get there. I imagined the Underground. Everything about it, the hate, the pale light the death that surrounded my being. When I opened my eyes, I was there again. And in the exact same spot was Shadow. Sitting there with a smug smile. ""Welcome back, _PERSON_..."" His tone was... lower... More threatening. I knew he wasn't playing games now. Neither was I. I glared at him for a moment. I stood and walked towards the chair he sat in. ""Tell me, everything. Now."" I commanded. He smiled. And begun to happily oblige.""_PERSON_ and I have been part of your life longer than you can imagine. I've been seeing your posts on Reddit, I know you think of me as 'slenderman' and some malevolent beast. But the answer to all your questions is actually a lot more simple than you'd believe. _PERSON_ never thought of you as a lover, though she has loved you. _PERSON_ you since the day you were born... and died."" I didn't understand, I died? I sat back down and continued to listen. ""You see, when you were born there were some... complications... They brought you back to life but not before _PERSON_ and I found you. You see, we're your surrogate family. Your dead family."" I shook my head. This couldn't be real. _PERSON_ had told me about the complications but I never heard anything bout being DEAD. ""You see,"" He continued anyways, ""We wanted you as OUR child. But if you just died and were expected to live with us then you'd not take to it so lightly. So we've been drip feeding you images of us and your new home. Your aptly named 'underground.' _PERSON_... She snapped. She said _PERSON_ was old enough and was trying to drive you into suicide. I told her that there was a simpler, more logical answer. Bring you here and never let you leave. Join us _PERSON_. We've been waiting sooo long for this moment."" He moved his hand through his hair and put on a grammy winning smile. I didn't buy it.I looked down and stood up clenching my fists. ""Get the fuck away from me and out of my life."" I told him, I... I lost my temper then. I swung and connected with him in the jaw. He was caught off guard. Needless to stay he stood up, a towering 7 feet tall. He punched me back. Or tried at least. I dodged and grabbed his leg, a coward's tactic, but I just wanted to win at any means possible. I toppled him over. He hit the back of his head on a table and grabbed it in pain. He groaned a howling groan, one the likes I've never heard at least. I didn't care. I straddled his chest and grabbed his head. I was furious. How dare they stalk  me for my life!? I grabbed his head and slammed it into the floor over and over again. A black substance oozed out of him... I think it was blood. I think. That's when _PERSON_ appeared. She pushed me off of him and started screaming something in Latin I think. Trying to get him to respond. He didn't of course, I at the very least knocked him unconscious. She continued screaming. I fell back onto my ass and was shocked. I had done what I had just done. I felt his skin on mine. It felt like he was real... I felt the ooze all of it! _PERSON_ turned to me then and slapped me. She continued to scream in Latin. I closed my eyes and wished to be anywhere else. I couldn't be there with him... with them. The 'blood' the screaming. I couldn't handle any of it. When I opened my eyes I was at home again. _PERSON_ and Shadow were gone, the 'blood' was gone. I opened up my Journal and furiously wrote what had happened. Every detail. I fell asleep then. Just passed out.I woke up a few hours later when the folks returned. I acted like nothing had happened. Went on with my life as if it was normal. You guys are the only one that knows what happened now. Believe it or not this is what I saw, this was as real to me as the words on this screen. I hope you enjoyed reading this, Because its the last one I'm going to write, probably. If you're lucky I'll post some more paranormal experiences that I've had. Those that were, 'yknow, one time things. It's been a week since the incident and _PERSON_ hasn't bothered me so I'm assuming she's long gone. Have a good night /nosleep... I know I will."

So please, don't judge me over my age. I hate it when people play the ""you're so young"" card. For the four years I knew her I lived with my mother. This last year I was sent to my fathers on the other side of the state.Anyways, so for the past five years of my life I've been in love with this girl: _PERSON_. She's saved me from suicide attempts more times than I could count and has never ever asked for anything in return. She's been my best friend and always helped me in everything I've ever asked of her. Well this last _PERSON_'s day, everything changed...I took a chance, and decided I was finally going to ask her out. We had known each other for so long, and she was finally single (As opposed to being taken until a year prior) so it just made sense. Well disaster struck: her friend committed suicide. As a good best friend I told her what my plan was, but that I wasn't going to do it now because of the circumstances. Her reply was: ""That's sweet, but I couldn't date you because it would be long distance now."" ""Well,"" I said, ""I guess I'll just have to not give up hope and win you back when I can go back there."" She told me she admired the determination. Well then my grades dropped like an overly-ripe apple and I got grounded for three months. Once I came back she had ""Exciting"" news for me: She had a boyfriend, on the other side of the country.This was heartbreak enough because it was *blatant* back stabbing. But it hit it's pique of hurt just yesterday..._PERSON_'s birthday was yesterday, and she and I had gotten into a fight because, while I'm at my mother's house for summer vacation, I couldn't visit her because my mother shipped me off to my grandmother's in the mountains. She and I made up later that night, so everything seemed fine. Until she told me her new boyfriend was in town to visit her...Now she's completely ignoring me, when I've loved her for five years and she's fully aware of that, and she hasn't even KNOWN this guy for one year...So what do I do Reddit? Should I just give up at let go and accept that I turned down five years of possible suitors over a girl I never really had a chance with... or do I persevere and keep going for her?

Done with any hope of becoming something important, or useful. Let's start with the most recent problems, and then move on to those that will effect my future forever.A girl broke my heart, Reddit. I know what you're gonna say ""Oh you're 16 you're so young you'll find someone new."" _PERSON_. I waited for a chance with her for six years, helped her through the end of three relationships, had her admit that if I asked her out in person when she was single I'd probably get a shot, and she STILL said no. Do you have any idea the level of betrayal I felt from that? Do you have any idea how hurt I am? I wasted six years, broke four hearts, and rejected three girls because I thought I had a *chance* with her. And in the end, I just got my heart broken. Because of that I'm considering Celibacy and or, well, suicide.More important reasons: I'm probably not going to graduate high school. I fucked off my freshman/sophmore years and now I'm paying for it. I think all in all I have like... six credits? MAYBE? If I don't graduate I can't get into a good college and become a high school science teacher like I've dreamed of. This is all assuming after I fail High school I plan to get a GED. I don't know what I'll do with myself if I fail, I already feel like I have no place in life. Any chance at counseling was either awful, or taken from me. In the Awful case, the counselor had no interest in me at all, only the money my mother was giving her as a requirement because my school deemed me ""unsafe to myself and or others."" I don't really know, I was kicked out of 7th and 8th grade, so I guess I never even graduated elementary school. In the case that was taken from me, I finally met a counselor that I connected with, shared values with, and felt like I could really get used to. Then my Dad pulled me out of the counseling office she worked at because he ""Felt like she wasn't helping, and was making things worse.""My mother, who I moved back with after a year of living with my dad for the aforementioned girl above, is controlling and has decided that I will do everything her way, or else she'll kick me on the street. How the hell am I supposed to meet all of her expectations when they aren't even realistic? She wants me to grow up, go to college, and then become a doctor. I don't even LIKE medical science. If I killed someone as a doctor I'd end up killing myself.The stress of my life is unbearable and for a few weeks I've been figuring out what I'll do to kill myself, and I've decided I'll go for the classic hot bath bloodletting technique."

1usgl6,7185,highseddit,1389267205,[Q] Getting back into the dating game?,"So, basically, here's my situation. I want to try to date again, I'm a clever and (at least I think) interesting 18 year old male who isn't particularly unattractive. Sure, I might not be everyone's cup of tea, but the real thing that's holding me back isn't a physical/personality thing, although it also could be that.The main issue, is that I just roughly 1 year ago, got spurned in a 8-year case of _PERSON_. At the burning downward spiral of our friendship/relationship we did end up dating for roughly a month, but that quickly was thrown away over a simple scuffle, and later we revisited the fight and she confessed that she never really intended to make it work, it was more of a ""pity"" thing, or at least I gathered that from the phrase ""I dunno why I went out with you, you just always wanted me to.""So my question is this, how do I get back into the dating game? Every time I try to get close to a girl I seemingly am put off my some invisible force, even though I have had *several* women say that they would date me, if there wasn't X blocking them. And, of course, X is usually ""If you weren't like a brother to me,"" or ""If I wasn't dating such-and-such (Specifically one time, one of my best friends)."" Am I giving off some sort of subconscious sign that I'm unfit as a partner or is there something else that I'm doing that could push women away?"

I'll try and cuddle with him and he'll sit there perfectly still with his hands in his lap almost alike he hopes I'll take the hint and leave him alone. This has been going on for a while now. I hear people complain that they only have sex with their partners a few times a week and I wish I could just laugh in their face. It makes me irrationally upset that they're so spoilt and taking for granted something that I get maybe once a month now. I'm tired of the complete and total lack of affection in our relationship and there's seemingly nothing I can do."

1wmjbi,14614,SuicideWatch,1391147130,Soulmates never Die,"From the beginning. I met a someone, lets call them _PERSON_ was the most amazing kind of perfect. S was everything I wanted in someone and I actually had the strength to tell S how I felt about S, unusual for me as I'm a shy person. Luckily S did not deny me. S and I were together all the time. Everyday we had the option we took it. S had a problem though, and I think I kind of noticed it, and in some way I want to help _PERSON_ may be paranoid, along with other mental things, S has been hurt and has a sad past. I did my best to make S happy, I was happy knowing I could make S happy. I had a problem. Life was boring, I didn't want to die, maybe meeting S showed me it was an option, but I never wanted to take it. I knew if I died, S would follow as S was probably suicidal. Sometimes I'd go to S at 2am because S was in trouble, with S or S's problems coming back to haunt _PERSON_ But S was getting better, the emptiness S had been feeling for so long, was going away, and I was happy I could be S's help, S's love. But then, S had to leave. S was taken away, 7128km back to S's original home. And we knew that at some point S would have to go home, but we both knew that we had never had this kind of relation, with anyone, we had to keep each other until we could be with each other, so we held on, even if we knew we had to wait. But since S has been gone, S has gotten back to S's old self. S is sad, depressed. S can't feel joy again. I try, I try so hard to make S happy, tell S things will be okay. S's mother is wrong and hurtful, S's friends are lies and somewhat against her. I talk to S whenever I can, but S has become distant, and wont talk to me. Seems too busy with her sadness. And S knows S is doing it, S will even say things like ""I'm so mean"" and ""I'm sorry, I'm not being nice to the one I love most"". I understand that what S does isn't because S want's to, but because S doesn't know what to do. Maybe S doesn't want to die, but I think S doesn't find happiness from anything, maybe just S finds it a waste when S will just die anyway. At this point, S's attitude is making me feel the same. I love S, and I don't matter, everything I did was for S, but now S is so far away and I can't help S like I did before. I worry for S because S is my future. We have plans to be with each other when both our worlds end. So, what should I do? How can I help S? What do I say to someone so empty they've lost the ability to listen to someone they love? I can't lose S, I mean, If S didn't want me anymore S would tell me, S is like that, and I would leave S because S wouldn't need me anymore. But thats not the case, S is becoming numb and I don't need help, I need to help _PERSON_ I don't think I'm depressed anyway. Maybe, but I know I'd be happy If I knew S was. S is all I have left, I hate to say this because It puts so much pressure on _PERSON_ We need to make it 7 months so I can visit S, I need to help S make it this far. Things are starting to lose meaning. I've never felt so empty, someone please tell me what to do, to save S, &amp; myself."

We're waiting for each other, waiting to be together, and she wants to be ""physical"" with others because I can't be there to do that for her, but its complicated because we agreed no sex with anyone, just kissing and I guess filling in the time cause its either fun or an antidepressant. The whole problem is that I have a bad time thinking about her kissing someone else, I feel so hurt and betrayed just knowing she wants to kiss someone that isn't me. How she explains it is, ""It shouldn't matter because we're not together"", but she also says ""They mean nothing, you are alpha and omega."" So she says that makes me a jealous person, does that? Is it wrong of me to feel like this when I think of her kissing someone? I've always felt that a kiss has meaning behind it so when I think that she wants to kiss someone I can't help but think theres motives besides ""just for fun"". I'm not used to that idea. I mean shes right. Because were not together if she needs to be with someone in that way, I should just know that that other person means nothing and just deal with my thoughts and not worry that whoever they are, they don't convince her to forget about me. Because thats one of my fears that who ever is ""taking-care"" of her will out do me, become better. She says that won't happen and ""but what if it does"" and she said she'll just tell me it has and we'd be done. But I don't want her to get the opportunity to find out that there are other people better than me.I can't tell her to not be with someone, she said if it hurts that much than tell me not to do it and I will, but thats so wrong of me to try to control her like that. but it hurts so much. I even tried doing what she is and look at others and I can't, I can't see someone and think ""they're pretty and I want to try kissing them."" It just didn't work, i felt no attraction, I easily thought that this person isn't my SO I don't want them. So in a way It feels unfair that she want's to be with someone else while she waits for me. If theres a better sub for this please tell me.So I need help, I need someone to tell me how to get past this, how to understand and just deal with it. I'm not leaving her because I want her too much. I just need help knowing she just wants me but will use others to feel happy while I can't make her happy and be okay with it."

I don't spend all day feeling like my body is an entire mismatch, only that something isn't quite right.

Despite being attracted to females (bi) I fantasize about being the woman in a relationship with a man and how much more natural it would feel for me.

While I am early in the process and have lots of therapy and introspection between me ad transition, I have 2 or three years of NCAA eligibility and I do not want to wait that long to start HRT.  While I can technically compete in male athletics while on HRT, my muscle mass will deplete within the first few months and I wouldn't want things to overlap.Here's my main concerns: - I am a rather good athete; I used to run at the division 1 level and even after a 2 year hiatus I will probably win conference championships in any event I run from the 1000m up to possibly the 5-10k, even if I do more than one.  My team is small and Division 3 and my contributions to the team gives us the chance to go to nationals in relays.  It's hard to leave the team when I've given people a lot of hope and spoken so much about the future.-I am worried about the impact that testosterone and training will have on my body if I prolong transition.  The earliest I could start HRT is probably 21.  If I continue track that could be 23!  While I'm sure I could lose the muscle mass I'd build by lifting and training, this is the critical age where my shoulders are widening, my ribs are opening out and I'm getting hairy and more manly.  I don't like that I have to choose between having a few extra seasons and damaging my potential to pass for the rest of my life.For extra consideration, I am studying engineering and I have 2-3 years left in which the courseload will become extremely hard to handle and track may be very hard.  I feel like doing all this in college is better because it is a more supportive environment and I do not want to pay NYC rent while paying off student loans and paying for the transition process.I'd love to hear what testosterone and training will do with an extra year or two and how I can deal with disappointing my coach and team for my own well being and happiness.  I have trouble putting my own needs ahead of a group larger than myself but I am worried and my dysphoria will probably get worse now that I recognize its existence.**TL;DR:  What happens if I wait a few years for HRT to continue athletics?

Will it be okay to mention that I am doing so?  Do clinical psychologists have any resources for referring to gender therapists?  I'm mostly concerned with finding one in the NYC area.  I'm open to recommendations. If I am getting this appointment through my mother's insurance, can I assume that she will have to find out no matter what?  Will I have to tell her that I am ""struggling with my identity"" in order to get this appointment?  It doesn't seem logical to come out to my parents *before* seeing the gender therapist as I'm still concocting reasons why I'm not trans (like that I've given up on having a backbone and assuming the male gender role and want to be someone else out of self loathing) and I'm afraid I will change my mind after coming out or not seem certain enough.Sorry for all the questions, I don't really have things together.

I've already worked as a busboy and a barista and I am not suited for these jobs.  I can work $30+/an hour as a private math tutor and do alright, but I'm curious as to the means by which a marginally skilled guitarist can make money through performances of any kind.  I would offer amazing startup lessons but I don't really know the cookie-cutter basic skills I would need to teach. - Where do I find places that pay for performances and what is the process by which all the exchanges occur? - How is the fee determined, if it is not simply a cut of the cover fee? - What materials should I have prepared? (Demos and what format is acceptable, basic equipment) - Any tips for basic recording with a soundhole pickup, audio interface and Garageband?Those are what I'm interested in, and that's a lot to ask, so if you want to refer me to where I can learn that would be appreciated.I play fingerstyle acoustic guitar in altered tunings and can play in the styles of _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, etc so I think I have something relatively unique to offer, but I don't know any of the logistics.I will add the tips to this post in an edit so that it can be used as a reference.edit:  I'm in NYC and plan on only supplementing my income with this.

15mt8i,42402,asktransgender,1356806234,Dealing with non-trans problems before transition?,"Hey everyone, I came out to my parents yesterday and while they took it reasonably well, my mother naturally is convinced that because I don't act or dress feminine that the decision to start hormones in a few month is too extreme and that I need to explore expression options that don't involve physical procedures, and deal with the issues that may be distressing me other than trans stuff (switching majors, getting an apartment, etc).So, it's pretty obvious to me she's trying to convince herself that I'm not really gonna do any of this or that some other problems are really the issue, and I'm assuming this will go away when she realizes I'm serious, but what can I even do in the next two months to make myself even more sure?  I can probably crossdress a bit more since the penalty for getting caught is less, but she pretty much invalidates all the time I've spent with you nice people on here (LOTS of time) because it wasn't face to face and wants me to find a support group with more trans people.  She probably thinks I will get scared out of it by all the hardships, and she even told me no one would hire a transgender teacher or tutor, herself included (I live in NYC).This might just be me venting but back to the point:  Will delaying transition to explore myself and settle other problems really help if being trans is part of the problem, and will staying off HRT contribute anything to me knowing myself better?  I feel like I know the answer but it's frustrating that my parents think their 20 year old son is rushing into something so fast."

(20 M/MtF),"For most of my life I was pretty hopeless about dating, mostly because I could not be myself when with women; I put on a man act because I was afraid of losing their interest.I thought I was gay, but the only thing I'm missing is an enjoyment for sex with men.  I've tried it many times and couldn't stay hard.  I was resigned to being a foreveralone with no hope and I was pretty hopeless about life.I used to joke to myself about being a lesbian in a man's body, but it turns out that's not far from the truth.  I'm going to be transitioning and living as a female in the next 6-12 months with the help of hormones and a lot of work, but I feel like I am unable to form meaningful relationships with women in the mean time.I don't find straight women that appealing because they prefer, and expect, masculinity from me and assume the submissive role that I would normally take in a relationship.  But while dating a lesbian girl who assumes the dominant role would be perfect, they don't find me attractive now and may lesbians seem to have a militant aversion to trans women.It seems that either I somehow must act masculine and have women attracted to me (hasn't worked, would rather play in traffic) or I be myself and no one will want me for at least another 1-2 years when I presumably pass as a woman at some level.  How can I make female friends and possibly more than friends in the mean time?**tl;dr:  I am the woman in the relationship but I am presenting as a male.

And I'm not comfortable with gay guys because I don't find *any* of them attractive and they are the only people on the planet who seem to find me attractive.  I turned my chat on in OKCupid with my profile listed as ""looking for girls"" and two of them messaged me within 7 minutes, and I cringed.  My inbox is *full* of messages from men and I cringe every time I get one.  It makes no sense that every gay guy on the planet wants to fuck me silly but women seem to find me repulsive.  When I was hit on by a girl from Columbia today I was totally set up by her to make weekend plans with her but I was incapable of asking.  I want to make friends with girls so much, but even though I seem calm when I talk to them I'm petrified inside and I sigh in relief/disappointment when they walk away.  I can't tell if it's an anxiety disorder, a side effect from Wellbutrine/Vyvanse or if I'm just fucking autistic.  Gonna go with autistic though.It's just kind of bullshit.  I'm neither male nor female now regardless of hormones, so I don't fit in anywhere and I never knew how to make friends in the first place.  Having a superiority complex with the self esteem of a suicidal person, aside from being a confusing oxymoron, is not helping.  It's not even clear if any of this has anything to do with dysphoria...I did go to a trans support group last week, the biggest one on the east coast, but it didn't help much.  Mostly people in their 60's who wanted my phone number and stood too close when they talked to me... not to be mean, but not my weekend crowd.How am I supposed to have female friends if they all think I want to fuck them or that I'm something that I'm not?  Am I really going to deal with this crap for 9 months?  With no weed or alcohol to drown my sobriety with?  The fuck.  I just needed to vent, sorry about that.  I would love some input on getting out of this hole"

We were chatting about how I should have more confidence with women, ""You have a huge dick just use it"" etc and I felt it was the right time.Granted, telling a 16 year old I'm transitioning while his finals are approaching is a bit of a miscalculation, but I got a call from my dad saying that I was not to tutor him for his final today like planned, and that I would not be staying in the house this weekend when they went away (as if I'm not gonna let him have someone over?  I digress.).  On top of that, they didn't know I was on HRT and now they do.  I assumed they did since it's on their insurance, but it seems I overestimated their supportiveness.Basically that means I can't see him, and since he lives in the family house, I can't go back to the family home.  It sucks because I know it's my mom's doing (my dad is very reasonable) and my mom probably put him up to it so I wouldn't think it's all her doing.  _PERSON_ shitty way to treat your children if you ask me; I'm looking for work and making some money stretch until I find a job and it's getting harder with this on my shoulders.  Depression and anxiety are enough without this.Parents who switch between supportive and batshit crazy are almost as bad as abusive parents; at least with abusive parents could leave them alone for good, parents who keep changing will reel you back in with kindness and then screw you over and over again. _PERSON_, just had to get this out.  I'm annoyed that a 16 year old was stupid enough to tell my parents after telling him not to and that they think he can't handle it.  I have an apartment so I'm not houseless, just homeless.Edit:  Seemingly not banned from the house, just from doing things with my brother.

2k5skd,42402,asktransgender,1414118091,"In transition, therapist died, feel like giving up.","I have been on HRT for a year and a half, and I had the same therapist since at least 6 months prior to starting HRT.  I am not super femme and I didn't question myself in earnest until age 20, but by my 21st birthday I was 2 months on HRT.Transition went well, and my therapy was good.  My therapist was very skilled, and knew how to say all the right things.  She complimented my appearance, gave recommendations for ways to express more femininity, and I felt happy.  I don't pass well and I came from a hypermasculine upbringing, but I was comfortable with being somewhere in the middle, but much more on the femme side.In Late April, about a year into HRT, my therapist died.  I moved out of where I lived to a place closer to home.  I stopped dressing up in girl mode, stopped being feminine, and went in many ways back to my former self.  Now I feel like it's never going to work.  I'll never be attractive the way I want to be, and I can't shake the fact that I was very good at being a boy, and HRT has made me very attractive among the male crowd.  I keep wondering if everything was in my head and if I just used my gender as a way to detach from the identity I hated, and the person I was.  Even though I like a lot about my body, acting feminine doesn't come naturally to me.  It is under so many layers even after all the work I put in.  My feminine characteristics seem forced, and I can't seem to form a personality that isn't masculine because I have low emotional intelligence and ruthless logic.  My voice still sucks, I haven't done laser, and I have no autonomy because I am depending on my family for financial support.  None of the other parts of my life are working out.  I regularly think about ending my life, and it seems like the logical thing to do.So that leads me to wonder:  Trans people always have the pre-transisiton cycle of trying femininity and then giving up and going back to hypermasculinity.  Does that keep happening into transition? Was my therapist egging me on or was it really my doing?/rantedit:  All your replies were very helpful.  I am feeling better today and I appreciate all of your input.  This is the bonk on the head I have missed for many months."
2m964o,42402,INTP,1415938993,INTP + No advanced degree = Useless?,"Generalizations aside, this is a problem that bothers me.  I like learning, I like teaching, and I work through material best in a non-structured environment.  I need a lot of time to work through material and let it stew before it solidifies into something I can be satisfied with in any way.  I'm having mental health problems and college is becoming impossible.  It is my 5th year.  I have 2000 level Mechanical engineering, 2000 level Psychology, 3000 level Math, and all of the pre-engineering science, as well as studio art and now some music theory.  I have been freelance tutoring at all grade levels and all subjects for 6 years with positive feedback.   I'm currently aiming at music, and I have 10 years invested in a musical instrument which I am now honing, but despite all this I'm completely unwilling to admit to having any specialized knowledge worthy of noting.  I am a hopeless Renaissance person.  If there were no obstacles, I think my ideal job would be in academia, either acquiring more knowledge, or transmitting it to other people.  The problem is that I am not functional enough to pass classes right now.  My anxiety and depression paralyze me before I can get through to the end.  If I do well in a class, it's because I spent the first month clearing almost all the material in the course, allowing myself to coast through midterms and finals despite my mind imploding on itself.  Much of the more technical parts of my career were acquired by brute forcing my way though immense stress and suffering, and even then, many of my engineering credits have been lost in a school transfer, and this style of study eventually led to a real, hard-hitting burnout.The crux of the issue is this:  How can someone with a complete lack of discipline, organization, planning, decision-making, and motivation possibly get through college?  How is thinking for the sake of thought and theory without application a viable skill outside the ""functional human being wall""?  The premise at hand is an INTP type simply to make a common ground.  I know one can't be contained entirely within a personality type and I want to avoid any fatalist assumptions.Edit:  Thanks for all your time and energy.

2yuw00,42402,SuicideWatch,1426206572,"Unable to change, slowly turning evil, exhausting resources, and headed towards death.","When I had given up and didn't try I had the luxury of knowing it would get better if I clung to life and worked hard.  Now I've been fighting tooth and nail and trying is not enough.  I still can't wake up on time and work towards my goals.  None of the rage, guilt, sadness, is enough fuel to push me from where I am to a place where can have any sort of autonomy.  I can't do anything for myself and my sleep habits and dietary habits show it.  When I plan to go to my college and practice piano and guitar all day, I sleep in and can't bring myself to go at all.  The frustration is unbearable, yet it isn't enough to lift me from where I am.  I know the only way out of depression ultimately not from the help of others but from doing it myself, but I simply can't.My personal relationships are evaporating.  I treat my older brother like crap constantly, even though he's had a much more painful life than myself.  I don't feel his love, or the love of my family or friends.  I'm unwilling or unable to register the emotions and I cannot return them.  If life were a novel, I would not be the main character, I would be the antagonist, given the same circumstances as the protagonist, but without love.  I feel rotten and violent.  I cut off a friend of mine because seeing the way everyone loves her and flocks to her makes me sick.  She's extroverted, has lots of supportive friends, and isn't very bright; my polar opposite.  I have no reason to hate her other than that she reminds me of all the things that I am not.  I grew up without empathy and I've hurt so many people without even realizing it.  I've never been able to communicate my emotions to others or be honest.  I've been dealt a very good hand and my problems would be trivial compared to eviction, physical danger, or lack of prospects. I'm in my 5th year in college after changing schools and majors, and decaying from a 3.8 in Mechanical Engineering to a 1.x taking two liberal arts classes a semester.  My only way out is applying to a conservatory and doing a full 4 years.  The dept chair knows I am talented and I can even get a full ride, but I just don't have it in me to experience 4 more years of pain and risk mediocrity and failure again.  Even as an accomplished professional doing something I ""love"" I may not be physically capable of happiness. I am the universe experiencing itself and I can't even feel the joy while walking through the park on a sunny day.  I am not even fulfilling the minimum requirement of life, experiencing the world as it turns.  I'm beginning to think that I have chosen death over life, not in a literal sense, but in that I am unwilling to help myself and experience the world and it really is my responsibility.  Death seems logical because I'm exhausting the resources of everyone around me and it is doing nothing.  I am too stubborn to simply exist in a form beneath my potential and now that I have quit smoking weed there is no escape for me, no way to feel peace.  I'm not planning on offing myself now, but I can no longer see anything else in my future but nonexistence.  If there was an ""Instant painless death"" button, I think I would press it."
3388lv,42402,legaladvice,1429534537,"Gave ""landlady"" less than 30 day notice, leaving a month-to-month room rental with no written lease. Can I still get my deposit back? (NYC)","I am in a month to month verbal agreement rental situation with a woman who is renting two rooms in her 5 BR apartment that is part of a co-op. I rent one of the rooms.  The rules were given orally:  No guests allowed, wipe out the bathtub and floors after every shower, things like that.  I mentioned it might be a good idea to make it a written lease to which the response was ""I don't play games."".I paid rent on time for several months while enduring harassment.  Sometimes it was small, repeatedly asking about dishes in my room (she had them all memorized), but the criticism was very frequent, sometimes many times in the span of just a few minutes.  She was condescending due to her older age and frequently insulted me and my upbringing.  Naturally, I did not feel that this was a good environment to live in and as soon as I was able to find an alternative housing situation, I notified her that I would be moving out at the end of the pay period, the day when I would normally pay rent for the following month.  This was less than 30 days from said date, and she said she would not be returning the deposit.  I asked why, and she said it was in our agreement.  I asked if she had the agreement in writing, and she said she didn't need it in writing, it was the law.The problem here is that the law applies to a landlord renting an apartment to a tenant, whereas she is a tenant renting a single room with access only to the bathroom and kitchen.  The fact that there was a ban on having guests further suggests that this does not fall under those laws, because that would be illegal under NYC housing laws.  So is there any way I can get my deposit back?  I would not be in such a rush to move if she wasn't bitter, and constantly harassing me.  The other person renting a room is unambiguously getting harassed due to his late payments, in a rather scary way.  It's only a $200 deposit but it matters to me.  Thanks for reading.  Let me know if clarification is required."

24wkhq,42279,legaladvice,1399416652,Apple - iMac caused iPhone Damage. Legal rights for repair?,"Hi,I've had a situation in whereby there was a software issue within Apple's OS X operating system drivers that power the USB ports. Whilst my phone was plugged in to charge, the USB ports repeatedly cycled on/off power to the phone. This caused it to constantly go into a state of charging / not charging etc. The iPhone vibrates when it enters or leaves a charging state and the constant switching means the phone was constantly vibrating. Because of this it vibrated and fell off the desk to suffer a crack to the screen. After contacting Apple they have fixed the USB port issue (not before I got a video of the problem happening for evidence) and the problem is no longer apparent, however the crack is still obviously in the phone screen. Apple say this is accidental damage and refuse to offer a repair unless I pay £216 (~$430). My argument is that the iMac problems caused a power cycling problem which in turn caused damage to the iPhone. Had this problem not been there the phone would be in a completely pristine condition. The phone is 6 months old, and is part of a 24 month contract with Three UK. I'm not sure if it was purchased on a credit card.Do I have any legal rights in getting a replacement or repair at Apple's expense without purchasing it and suing them for the cost of the repair?"

The send button is never enabled (ironic).   2) Experienced an issue in the Health App when selecting my birthdate the UIDatePicker kept automatically scrolling back to 02/06/2014  3) I cannot set a Birthdate from my Emergency Card  4) When selecting an Emergency Contact and tapping the person, it proceeded to call them  5) Unsure if this is intentional but when the Control center is visible the background goes a darker colour. Increasing the brightness makes this suddenly go lighter then back to dark  6) TouchID is not being recognised at the Pass Code screen  7) Search does't appear to work in the Messages App (pull down from list of conversations)   8) iPhone getting VERY VERY hot with light usageEdit: Not complaining with this, As a developer I expect this. Just wondering if anybody else has other bugs or major issues they've noticed?"

Part of my management strategy of my mental health at the moment involved self harm, I have it agreed with my psych 'rules' around it (like calling the Crisis Team first, trying alternatives) but sometimes I really need it as a last resort in stressful situations that could cause me to be more unsafe if I didn't solve it myself.I do not advocate self harm in any way, I would do anything to stop somebody from starting. And I'm slowly reducing it myself, but I have to look at the bigger picture I guessI was just wondering if its possible to actually get bandages or gauze etc. on a prescription in the UK? Sort of like how you can get free condoms to be safe, its better to try and take care of things rather than leave them. Any thoughts would be appreciatedTake care and stay safe guys x"
2e3l0r,42279,legaladvice,1408556039,Resigning during probationary period (UK),"Hello,There is a girl at my place of work who has handed her notice in after working there for around 5 months. She's been called selfish by her boss and is being treat horribly by the managers. There are two questions I wanted to ask on her behalf about her situation1) She has 2.33 holidays left. I believe legally this should be rounded up to 2.5 however they are refusing to let her take these holiday which I assume would instead be added to her final wages. Is this legal?2) She handed a notice in for 4 weeks time, however since she is on the probationary period she is not required to provide any notice of her resignation. Since the holidays were denied which I assume is against the law and the treatment of her has made her anxious about coming to work, is she legally bound to work those 4 weeks or is she able to leave in say 2 weeks instead or immediately? Thank you."

He posted some pictures on Facebook and he looked like he was having a really really good time. He's also a flirt; I caught him chatting up one of my friends, and they were exchanging filthy messages about sex, etc. And a lot of guys keep on flirting with him too. My gut is telling me he's going to cheat eventually, or has already cheated on me.&amp;nbsp;I'm in a bind, and I don't know what to do. I don't know if this relationship is worth it anymore.

It's just me and God.  Only God knows what will happen to me.  Although all I can do is pray to God, but I am scared of what can happen to me as I wait for my prayers to be answered.  Yes,  I've tried talking to my family,  friends and mentors but they either say it is a phase,  or Just Seek God or I just have no reason to feel this way.

I want to depart from this painful depression, the self injury, the countless ongoing thoughts of suicide, and  the few attempts to put an end to my life.  I need to help myself, and this is my final decision. And if you're wondering,  why I am not currently doing anything at this moment, it's because I have to prepare all my documents or necessary paperwork that may be needed for both school or hospital. Or if something was to happen and I am unable to return back home for an extended period of time, all of my things would be available to find,  if I was to need anything. Plus, I need to speak to a few highly trusted important people,  which I am almost done with that task. I should be ready to make this decision go into action by the coming Monday. No more turning back,  time to take care of myself."
2vgmdb,29993,depression,1423603899,"Hey guys, how long did it take you to start feeling better with any kind of treatment?","So, loads of things happened back in January. At the time, I've finally reached to the point that I couldn't keep myself together. I was in bad shape, the prolonged sad feeling wouldn't go away, the suicidal thoughts wouldn't shut up with struggles of self harm. Therefore, I admitted myself to the ER and then I got transferred to a stabilization unit/residential hospital, where I stayed there for about a week. From there I've received my diagnosis with severe MDD and been put on medication with effexor. Now fast forward to now. Since my discharge from inpatient,  I've been going to outpatient services, which I've already been to two therapy sessions, and will soon follow up next week with my psychiatrist about my medication, then after another week,  my third therapy session. Honestly, I feel a lot more tired with this medication, and I find myself calm at times. Suicidal thinking still lingers from time to time but it has lessen a great deal, and I sleep a whole lot more. However, I'd still be feeling at my worst. I'd be in bed wide awake at 3am: ""I don't want to do anything. I don't want to know anything. I don't want to see anybody. I don't want to speak to anyone. Please please please leave me alone please. I'm stupid, useless and I'm worthless.""So as far as I'm concerned, therapy is still going great, but I realized I have a lot of fixing to do and it's going to take a long while til I get there. Concern #1: But this medicine is what gets me insecure, how long does it take for that stuff to start working? Or would I end up having to switch for a different pill? &amp; I don't know if the following information can make any justice but here it goes: I am a 21 yr old female college student,  studying for psychology. I have no job, can't legally drive yet (for fear that I can simply drive off and it could be the last time anybody would have seen me alive). I've struggled with this awful sadness since I was 12 but it comes and goes with or without self harm and/or eating disorders and suddenly it's just here to stay, just sadness with self harm to cope with it all. In all means, this psychiatric encounter is the first time I ever been evaluated by a psychiatrist and receive diagnosis and treatment for it. It took a long 9 years to carry this burden and I'm finally going to address the issue. So yeah,  the struggle is real for the most part. Apart from that, I am a busy bee, always wanting to handle everything,  and highly involved with activities on campus, church and whatnot. If applicable to anyone who can give me advice for this one,  it's understandable if y'all can't answer:Concern #2: I have reached out to many types of people about this. Some people shy away or simply say,  don't over think things,it's a waste of time, or the infamous: ""what do you have to be sad about? you are lucky to go to college and have an easier life than mom and dad back in their days at their home country."" And then there's these people, don't get me wrong,  I love them so much and I do think of similar values that a Christian would want in their life but whenever I go to them (any of the trusted adult members) about this painful struggle, I get lectured about how ""I need to pray more or harder and put all your troubles on God and He will listen"". I do believe in all of those things but, it was basically a ""been there done that, what part do any of y'all don't understand?! I need help!! "". So yeah,  this is all confusing to me. Any advice/suggestions or questions are highly welcomed!! :D"
2vvmba,29993,depression,1423927643,Living with my depression. A mix of descriptions that goes through my head every day.,"The thoughts that brings up a storm every day in my head: I hate myself.  I don't deserve to be here. It's my fault, everything I do wrong is my fault,  I'm sorry. I'm stupid. I deserve punishment. I don't have the right to be happy. What am I doing wrong? Why am I always to blame? I'm so sorry. I messed up. Why can't I have my shit together like any other college student? Do something,  minimariee,  do something, minimariee,  why aren't you doing anything?! Why do I feel paralyzed? Do something!! Stop being this way, nobody wants to be around you. Everyone is sick and tired of your shit. Stop being such a wuss. Stop being so sad. Stop it. I deserve to punished for everything that goes wrong. Go ahead,  do it. I cut because I need something to counteract with the emotional pain that I am in. I can't cry because I feel like I don't have the right to feel this way and I find it to be weak for me. I have to put on my masks for the day to keep going. I get myself cleaned up and dressed to look like I got all together. Nobody suspects a thing. I live a life of a lie. And I just want to die so bad but I can't. I just want to disappear so badly because I don't want to be a burden to others anymore. Please help me. Please understand me. Please don't shove the religious card in my face,  I know. I just needed someone to understand. A shoulder to cry on, so much for having a ""great"" support group, I know they get tired and impatient with me and my depression. I'm so sorry. And yeah,  the stressors that keeps my head spinning over and over again."
2w49ro,29993,depression,1424121701,And this is why I can't open up to anyone.,"I am like, 100% done with trying speak to anyone about helping me with my depression. On the brightside I finally am seeking help to address with my MDD... but it looks like I have a few people who just don't understand even though they helped me get to that first step: finding help. Now I just want to disappear because I am so sick and tired of hearing the same opinion each and every time. If they say these things ""just trying to help"" then they are completely wrong because I find it highly discouraging for me to continue with my recovery. And another thing that I want to mention that I am not trying to shame any type of religion or putting it to blame but hear me out please. So, I am a Christian, and have or what appears to have some strong friendships with my Christian peers. I opened up to them and at first, they were supportive and encouraged that I keep praying to find the answer. Then, a couple of weeks later, I have reached my highest point and I just couldn't take it anymore and decided to turn myself in to the hospital where I know I would no longer be in harm's way and to get evaluated. Then I got admitted to inpatient treatment. Once I got out, I was handed my regular schedule for outpatient treatment and regimen to continue taking my antidepressant. Well, no one was really happy about all that ""mess "" that I did at all. My best friend is completely against with the whole medication thing, she starts seeing me like I was some kind of"" pill popping addict"". And let me tell you, my daily medication consists of one 150mg of Effexor pill a day... taken every morning. I honestly really hate it that she's just not understanding that I am not okay and that yes,  I still love and still keep my faith towards God and she comes back at me like, ""if you're completely happy with _PERSON_, then you shouldn't be wasting your time taking useless pills and therapy"". And another one that she would tell me ""stop taking those pills,  lay off the pills, if you're still getting sad, or having nightmares...etc"". Or ""if you sought more into the power of prayer, you shouldn't be this way taking all these pills and being all sad and stuff"".  That's just hurtful and discouraging. It's not like,  I'm telling her that doing my efforts as a Christian doesn't work for me, it has done so much for me and I still and love _PERSON_.. but I just needed additional help to calm the storms that puts me in a bad place. Nobody has any idea how awful that makes me feel. I understand that it will take time for me to start feeling better... Which I just barely started in January... but it isn't going to be fixed overnight. Nobody realized how terribly broken that I do have my moments where I do malfunction as a human being and no matter what or how I tell anyone who expresses the same way like my best friend, I feel so trapped and invalid, even when they react so poorly."
2wva4v,29993,depression,1424698141,I have no purpose to keep on living anymore. Why bother?,"Seriously, why do I even bother anymore? If I could just simply remove myself from this life, I can guarantee that everything would be 100% much easier on my loved ones. No more worries. No more hypocrisy. No more stressing out over me. No more hiding the fact that this girl right here is a ""nutcase"". My friends aren't really my friends. They are best friends with a friend of mine that I consider her my best friend, only to know that I'm pretty sure that she doesn't really see me as a best friend and that those ""friends""  are just being respectful. I just want to go away. I simply am not wanted anywhere on this world. My whole life is just one huge lie that I've mastered in making this seem so believable. I don't know what I am even supposed to be doing in this lifetime but I just want to be gone for good. Vanished. That way,  neither my ""loved ones"" and I wouldn't have to suffer any longer. So therefore, I cannot be deemed to be seen as selfish, because I'm not, I want to do this for their benefit. It's selfish enough for me to keep living and ruining their lives, being a complete burden for them. I want to be free from this life that keeps me feeling like I'm trapped here forever. And I'm so sorry. I've tried everything. There's no purpose for me to go on."
2y15lm,29993,SuicideWatch,1425571333,I'm sorry.,"I mess everything up. Today is the day that I should just give up completely. I'm not meant to be loved. I'm not a very good person. I tried and I failed, okay? I want to end it all, one less thing for anyone to worry about. Goodbye."
2zqbeg,29993,depression,1426878971,How do you tell someone about this?,"So, my medicine dosage has been raised another 75 mg.. which means 225mg a day in my third month with effexor. How do I explain to several people that it isn't the medicine or overall treatment that is making me worse? I've been this bad or worse to begin with and they simply don't understand why I was given a higher dose? They'd look at me and tell me that I didn't seem all that bad or question me with what's the reason that could possibly be making me sad... making me feel like my so called ""declining"" well being  didn't even have a valid reason. They would tell me that I am living the easy life and I had no reason to feel this way."
2zzugx,29993,depression,1427102534,Who am I and why am I still alive?,"I have no right to remain living, breathing because that is by far the most selfish thing that I have done. I just want to get out of their way. See? By simply removing myself from this life... now I'd be considerate of their needs. No more worrying, no more having them to waste their breath on me."
308ufj,29993,StopSelfHarm,1427286623,I'm glad for the small victories but...,"So, I've been slightly over a month clean free from cutting. The cuts/scars are now just blemishes but they're noticeable especially since I still have my pale ""winter"" skin colour. Yesterday, I decided to go workout in shorts and a tank top, and the weather was very lovely and warm but I had some dread feeling of self-consciousness about my scars. Then I thought, well no one is going to look directly at it the first time they see me, and if my friends sees it and questions about it, I'll be honest about it. So, I went outside and had fun with my friends and went to workout and for the longest of times of being ashamed about my scars, I gave zero fucks and acted like I was a complete normal human being. :) The hardest part for me now is to keep fighting off my urges to cut. And I want to so badly but I know that I can do it. *mini-victory dance*"
33t3e3,29993,SuicideWatch,1429957571,Is it just me or...,"I have never been so, unhappy, uncomfortable, uneasy. I'm at the brink of succeeding suicide but every time I tried, I somehow managed to fail. Is it just me or some other reason as to why I feel so bummed for not killing myself? I feel this desperation to finally put myself to rest and I am so frantic to making it happen. I have no purpose to keep going anymore. My job here is done. I also want to go back to my old ways but those are only temporary and I just want to be gone for the benefits of other people. I've done enough hurting. I don't want to cause anymore pain to them they deserve a much calmer happier life."
33tc4z,29993,SuicideWatch,1429965943,I don't have time for this...,"Every visit I go to see my psychiatrist or therapy session gets more bothersome because I know I should be open and honest but at times I feared that I could end up going back to inpatient in the Mental Health care unit. I just needed to stay afloat for the next two/three weeks until my college spring semester is over. I couldn't bear to drop everything and miss a ton of work at college. But yeah, I feel like that I am lying at every visit and couldn't tell them that I tried killing myself but it failed or that I'm still cutting and had a relapse with my bulimia or bruising myself. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm stuck. I honestly don't have the time to put my life on hold and get much more intensive care for myself."
34m2md,29993,depression,1430564782,I honestly have no time for this.,"So, I went to therapy a few days ago and I was pretty open about the things that has been going on lately. Even about my suicide attempt. Then I was asked if I should go back to the hospital unit... I then replied that I don't have time for those things because I have college finals to do and I'm close to starting my new job and such... Fuck. But I don't feel so great at all. I'm falling apart and I just don't want to keep living anymore. I'm just a huge burden and cause too many problems to the people I loved. I want to disappear for good, for the best. I know it is selfish to leave behind... But they will do much better without me. And I feel like it is already selfish of me for taking up space and taking up the abuse. I I don't know, should I drop everything and attend to my needs or continue on with the very little energy that I have for myself?"

xqdhy,12716,SuicideWatch,1344204209,Family are driving me to the breaking point.,"I've been depressed probably for over 6 years, but only diagnosed 2 years ago. I recently turned 19, and of the same day my mother kicked me out of the house because I stayed up too late at night and it kept her awake (though partly true, I know most of it was a lie as she would make up times that she saw me awake). I went to live with my father, which was good for about 3 weeks, in which time I have found online courses which I plan to take, planned to move to a Scandinavian country for a little while after getting a job and I had generally sorted my life out (bar getting a job). During this time, however, I tried going back to my mothers to show her I have changed three times. Each time before getting a chance to prove it, she would accuse me of not changing at all. This made me feel really f***ing annoyed as I have changed so much in such little time, and they she doesn't even care for the risk of her 'sleeping' pattern. Apparently she used to be depressed also so I would have thought she would understand... Obviously not.So anyway, I was meant to sort out applying to a course yesterday with my father at the _PERSON_, but then I backed out as I know there are plenty more course online that are just as good and free/cheaper (a thank you to /r/programming for finding them). So I told him this, and he was skeptical but didn't mind.Later on in the evening I was asking my sister if she could give me a lift somewhere (she lives with my mother full time, never sees my dad) and she said that my mother could do it. I said after the three times of trying to change I am not willing to see her. This is when she goes all hypocritical *'you're disgusting for not seeing your mother'* on me, before telling me my mother is the best thing to have happened to me and I should 'open my eyes'.This extremely offended me as it was so hypocritical that she never sees her dad, so I explained to her my thoughts and then told her she should open up her eyes, or at least her heart to see him a few times a month. She then accused me of starting arguments and won't speak to today.Now today - my father is getting annoyed as I haven't applied for one of the courses yet and says time is running out. Thing is I have over a month to apply for these courses, but I still plan to by the end of this week. After telling him this he still got annoyed and said it was too soon.Then there is my _PERSON_, my mother's mother, who lives next door to my father (yea weird I know). She's always phoning me on my mobile and telling me to say sorry to my mother, despite not knowing what I have done. She hasn't even been told my mother kicked me out. If I didn't have respect for elders, or people in general, then I ould have told her to _PERSON_.So basically, story ends here, end of rant, two days ago I was the happiest in a long time. This evening I'm now considering either applying for the course or just killing myself. I don't want to, and I'm flipping scared of death, but I see it as the only way to get away from all this bollocks I've put up with."

My life sucks and boy, do I know it.I recently decided to sign up for some free software programming courses online (Udacity and _PERSON_) but as usual, I've grown 'bored' of that and I again don't have a clue what to do with my life. I had to drop out of college as it was getting too much for me (depression and motivation, I was able to understand it all relatively well.) which meant I couldn't pursue my life-long dream of being an astrophysicist or astronomer (I don't know if there is much of a difference... silly _PERSON_ problem of mine is my parents. Games. According to them, games are the cause of depression. I don't want to come across as a know-it-all... But that is flipping absurd. I think it is safe to say if I wasn't playing games, I would have probably committed suicide about a year ago. Games are fun, relaxing and take your minds off of things that make me want to end everything. Why is this causing my depression? It isn't. Am I addicted to gaming, however? Nope. I could easily stop and do other things like going out with friends.. If they show up. They don't, so I carry on playing games. This gets ignored and I'm constantly told how I'm the one not trying to help myself.Now to that, you may say 'Well, Stinky, why don't you get a job?' Well there is a perfectly good explanation for that, which again, gets ignored. I have a very small amount of motivation to do the things I love (going out with friends or going out hitting some sweet DH tracks on my bike). This makes that a massive challenge. Now I know I said earlier that I can easily do these things, but that's because I psych myself up, get pumped, think about all the fun I will have. That takes a good few hours, before that I won't do flip all. When it comes to something I'm not too keen on doing, such as working (please don't take me as one of those ""I don't want to work, so I won't"" type of people, my father already accuses me of that enough (for the record he is a fat, lazy sod)) then it becomes very hard. I do hope I am not the only person here who feels this, but even when I had a job working  at a local shop, and met a girl who worked there who I may very well fancy the arse off (I.. I don't mean I look at her arse, I mean I like her a lot) and I loved talking to, I found it hard to go in to work. Luckily the reason why I left was due to the end of contract, and not being fired. (I also doubt I'll ever man up and ask her out, I'm a nancy when it comes to that).There are many other problems I have which I could list, but anyway, I have a proposition.**Proposition**I know we have this sub-reddit dedicated to depression, but most of it is requesting for help, etc... (I don't mean to make this sound bad, this is a brilliant community and I'm sure it has helped many people, as it has helped me once before). My proposition is we make a website/forum/blog for us sufferers. It would have things like tests to see if you're depressed or how depressed you are (only to get an idea, going to the doctor will help more), posts about how we (me and anybody else who wants to help) have overcome certain situations as I'm sure many of us have experienced the same things, if only a bit different, and general news regarding depression or other topics that may interest you. The forum would have many sub-forums, maybe ones similar to this sub-reddit to help (though I don't want to take people away from here), some to share tastes in music or hobbies that may help or are just generally fun, and maybe even gaming threads.Though the main part of the website would be similar to that of CBT (cognitive behavioral test). I had to do this recently, and I found it to be quite... derogatory, I think is the word I'm looking for. Basically, it made me feel bad with the scripted woman saying 'Oh that must be so bad for you, I see how you feel bad' among other things;A) It seems like a childish response when you know you aren't talking to anybody irl.B) Her voice sounds somewhat.. sarcastic.C) Rather than making me feel like I wasn't the only one, it made me feel as if I was being grouped and we were all being told the exact same thing.D) It's so booooorrrriiiiinngggggg!So why don't we make a community that helps each other! Rather than the CBT (though we could have something similar) we could have group sessions (online, of course) kind of like a group meeting or AA, and discuss our problems online in private and then give each other ideas on how they could help their own situation (for example myself, I have no clue how to make myself go out and get a job, but explaining my situation to people who understand, they could give me advice and help). I feel as though, not only would this help me (in two ways - doing something with my life and getting help from others) but it could also benefit many others too. I've had a little dabble with website design before, but I'm not expert so I may require help if the idea is liked enough. And I'm sorry if somewhere already does this, then I should be scolded (_PERSON_, would anybody like this as an option? And if so, can I get some help with making it? Thanks!S-_PERSON_"

13yojd,12716,ShouldIbuythisgame,1354146715,SIB: Miasmata? (Recently Green-lit on steam),"I saw this game has just been released on Steam for £10.79 (not sure in USD) and wondered if anybody has given it a go? Is it worth said price?I do enjoy survival games (MC, Don't Starve, Terraria) along with First Person games.**EDIT - MY EXPERIENCE WITH MIASMATA:** I went ahead and bought the game. I'm around about 2 hours into the game now, and there are definitely lot's of pro's and con's. I haven't got into a fight with that lion/goat thing yet.**Let's start of with the pro's:**-*Cartography system*: Wow. This really has been pulled off really well. You have to actually use landmarks on the map (which you draw when you find... I guess map segments). This adds a real sense of realism that really makes you feel like you're reading a map IRL (well.. duh!)-*Music*: The music is really calming, though doesn't always play (which is probably a good thing). It reminds me of some of the slower songs from TES:Oblivion, and really adds to the atmosphere.-*Gameplay*: For the most part, the gameplay is really fun and has interesting systems. The way you make potions is fun, and only being able to hold *three* items really makes it better as you only carry what's important. Other things also add to the fun.-*Wildlife/Scenery*: There is a lot going on around you in this game. Birds, butterflies, frogs and squirrels are among many things you'll see wandering the island. The trees/grass are all animated really well and the realistic art style fits very well.**Now for the cons:**-*Sound effects*: Some of the sound effects are pretty decent, but majority of them don't sound great at all. More of a nitpick rather than a reason not to get the game, however.-*Slopes*: OK, so granted your character IS ill, but really, it is so hard to climb even slight inclines in this game. It got pretty annoying after a while.-*Graphics Settings*: The graphics are nice, but if you have a low end PC, you may not want to try it. My PC is mid-range (eg, runs BF3 on medium at about 30fps), and I run this game at around 25fps on high settings. There are only two settings for all graphics options, High and Low. When switching to Low, the game crashed, and upon restarting everything went haywire. I had to change graphics back to high then restart the game in order to play again.-*FOV/_PERSON_*: The FOV (field of view) in this game is pretty small, and I don't think there is a way to change it. Low FOV on PC games makes me a tad queasy, so hopefully this get's added. Regarding character control, it feels sluggish. Moving around isn't nice, and it's hard to maneuver over small objects or slopes. Just looking around feels, well, not great.-*Water*: Let me start off by saying the water in this game looks *amazing*! However, it only looks amazing at short distances. Even though the water effect is nice, as are the reflections on it, at a distance it looks as though there is way too much going on and looks pretty horrible.**Overall Verdict:**This game IS fun, but there are bugs and annoyances. I would say I'm leaning towards it is worth the price, though I think you may be able to get it cheaper elsewhere (GOG.com). From what I can tell from other reviews, the fighting the monster is reasonable (again I haven't met it yet). If my problems with the graphics settings are not just for me, I would wait for some sort of fix first (unless it goes on sale). I am also hoping that there will be many things added into the game like more graphics options/FOV/etc... but I am unaware of it's current build so it may be complete or it may be in Alpha.So yes, this game is worth it (in my opinion, others may disagree), but only if you can put up with some bugs and annoyances.I'll say 6.5-7/10 - would be more if less bugs, but gameplay is solid for the most part.Wow... that was a ramble!"

1818sg,12716,depression,1360197933,Small things feel like a huge burden. Any ideas?,"Basically, I've had depression for a good few years but in the last 6 months pretty much everything has gone to pot. I became very reclusive when I went to college despite being an active and relatively happy teen (16 at the time, now 19). I had a job this time last year which was just a christmas temp, but I was offered to stay on as a permanent worker (part time) but Iturned it down as I was feeling terrible by the end of it. Then shortly after I dropped out of college where I was retaking a year I failed. This is because I skipped pretty much every class as they felt like a huge burden. More recently some bad stuff has happened at home and I'm feeling worse than ever. Before I used to think of being dead, but now I actually see suicide as a viable option. Each day I feel like it will happen sooner and sooner. I've tried to get help from doctors and counsellors but due to my nrwly formed reclusiveness my parents tell them what they think the problem is. The outcome? I'm told to get a job.I know I need a job and I want my social life back, but I can't even make myself do something I enjoy. Even if that thing requires mo effort like just going on a computer game, despite being at a computer all day everyday.Anyway, on to my point. I'm meant to be having a haircut tomorrow but I plan to cancel. All it is is a mere 20min haircut, and yet it feels like a massive burden on my shoulders. Everything does. Things I enjoy like going biking or meeting people. And when I feel like I have a huge burden on my shoulders I get more depressed than before and rhink about everything bad. It's basically killing me. Hell, I was meant to be meeting a real sweet girl on the weekend. My friends say she probably ""likes"" me, but thanks to overthinking things I'm now certain her mother (who works with and talks to my mother a lot makes her talk to me because I am so flipping hopeless. I sound insane, I know.I really need advice on what to do. Everything, no matter how petty or large, feels like a huge burden. What should I do?"

18nnxn,12716,SuicideWatch,1361050576,Suicide is quickly becoming the only option.,"I have nothing in my life. I do nothing with my life. I am a waste of space. All I do is sit in front of a computer all day and eat. I'm living with my father, but the only contact I have with him is when I go down to get food. He treats me like shit but it's the only place I can live. My mother kicked me out after she started an argument with me after I told he I feel suicidal. ""How do you think I feel having to raise you,"" and shit like that. She shouted at me endlessly whilst I tried to stay calm, at which point I left. I went to my father's house and attempted to cut my wrists, but I barely managed to bleed. I had written a suicide note too. After about 3 hours of listening to music my mother somehow gets in the house and finds me trying to cut. I just got up and left telling her to fuck off, then went for a walk in the local woods for about 6 hours. I contemplated jumping off a 40-60ft cliff but the amount of dog walkers put me off. I went home, then me and my father got my things from my mothers house and took them up here to where I am now. It's a fucking shit hole, I've tried to clean up but he carries on being a fucking scrub. He gets massively infuriated over trivial things (e.g I said I would be able to make us both lunch in 10 minutes rather than straight away. He goes batshit). I want to move down to my Mother's house as it is a much nicer environment (despite her being a massive cunt also) but I'm not allowed to unless I apologise for what I wrote in the suicide note she found. It essentially said how my parents are the fuel for my depression and I backed it up with examples of how the treat me, things they do, etc...I went to the Doctors, and they tell me I need a job. (I'm 19, btw). When I dropped out of college for ""being lazy"", which only my physics teacher understood to be depression and listened to me at the time, I did some volunteer work, followed by working in a Super Market. I would say I was getting better, but when my work contract ended at the Super Market I turned down the offer to carry on there, and quit the volunteer work as I was far worse than before. When at the Doctors, my parents say their side of the story and I never get a chance to speak, so to them I'm just a bit depressed. I can't even motivate myself to do things I want to do. I sit at a computer all day being told all I do is play video games. Nope. I do nothing. I can't motivate myself to play games. I love mountain biking, but I can't motivate myself to go riding. My friends are awesome, but I can't motivate myself to go to the pub for a few hours. I can't even motivate myself to go out with the girl I like, she knows I've had ""mental problems,"" and she has had some too, but I can't tell her why I don't meet her because I don't want her to think I'm making excuses not to see her.So, I have nothing. I am nothing. I have no education to do the jobs I want to do. The one job I do want to do (and the ONLY thing I am motivated in the slightest for) I'm ""not allowed to do"" as it's ""not a real job."" I want to try, but my parents are holding me back. I'm 19 for fucks sake not a bloody child. I see no point in going on. Until recently I've always been afraid of death. I'm an atheist so as far as I'm concerned death is final. Now it just seems better to get it over and done with. I don't know how soon; it may be a few days, or a few weeks, I'm not sure, but what I am sure about is that I won't make it to 2014."

1cytdu,12716,depression,1366755279,"Would like some help/advice - My family are calling my depression laziness. Am I really just lazy? [Long read, sorry]","Hey guys. I'm 19, from UK, been diagnosed with depression (by a doctor) for about 3 years (feeling bad for much longer), and the last two years I've done bugger all with my life.I would like to point out my mother was present at every meeting we had with a doctor, including when I was diagnosed. She too is apparently dealing with depression, though I'm not sure if I believe the extent of it. My father is supportive, but convinced that depression doesn't exist and is an excuse for being a lazy sod.I dropped out of the second year of college do to many reasons (explained later), and dropped out re-taking it the next year. I volunteered for 4 months at a charity shop where I worked 1 day per week, but hated it. I then had a job at a local supermarket for a 3 month contract, and also hated it. I was offered a permanent job there but I turned it down as it was too much. I was only working two days a week when I left. At both places the people were lovely, but I dreaded them almost every waking hour, even if I had a few days of no work/college or was busy with something else.I stopped them for one main reason. I hate being out in public/in an area with large groups of people. I like being left alone at my computer or on my bike, nobody to talk to bar friends over the internet, or with the one riding buddy I have. I can barely handle about 5 people at a time. Having to see people, even those I'm familiar with, causes a lot of stress and anxiety, and I can't make myself go into public on my own.About 3 months after finishing the Supermarket job my mother started making comments about how much happier I was back then. I'm pretty certain she has just convinced herself this as I felt extremely stressed the whole time working there and was actually pretty happy when I turned down the opportunity to carry on.That was just under a year ago. Over the last year I've had some seriously shit moments, two of which I tried to attempt, but backed out of, suicide. For a month or two leading up to the first go, until now, I've thought about killing myself every single day. Originally I didn't for my family, but now I don't care. After the second go, my mother found my suicide note, then told my grandparents that I just wrote her an offensive letter, who all then ganged up on me and told me to apologise. I refused, but didn't tell them why. I'm pretty certain they are still angry with me 3 months down the line. For the last 5 or so months my mother keeps commenting on how I should stop being lazy and get a job. I know I need one but I can't make myself do it. I try tell her why but she dismisses it. I had hoped she would understand as she is meant to be depressed also. My sister (21) also tries to be ""helpful"" by endlessly telling me I'm fine. Real helpful.I've recently been working on something online, but the lack of support from anybody bar a few online friends has made it pretty tough. My mother happily tells me how I shouldn't even bother trying.Last week I applied for a job at a local bike shop, hoping it was part time. I had an interview about it this morning, which made me feel physically sick, but I went anyway. Beforehand my mother made a sarcastic comment about me not going. She says a similar thing about almost everything I do. Anyway, back to the job. As I have knowledge in the area there's a chance I may in fact be offered the job, but it is full time. I know I won't be able to handle it, I can hardly handle things I want to do, such as go to pubs/clubs with mates. They make me extremely stressed out no matter how much I try not to worry. I was hoping for part time to attempt to get used to it before finding something full-time or until the online thing picks up (may never happen).This evening I said to my sister I don't want the job as full time will be too stressful. She has a go at me saying I'm just coming up with excuses not to get a job, before going to tell my mother. She proceeds to treat me like a child like she always does and just calls me lazy.I can understand why other people think I'm lazy. I'm pretty certain a lot of my friends think I'm massively lazy and don't give a shit. But I don't understand why my mother, father and sister all seem to be dismissive of the depression. So I'm asking for an outside point of view, am I just really lazy? Not meant as sarcasm/satire in any way, really, am I coming across as just a lazy sod who's convinced he's depressed?If you want more details about things just ask.Thanks"

At the end of the match I was top fragger by a small amount, but the other team still won.Now to what pissed me off - two members on the other team kept filling up chat with accusations of us three players hacking. Why?They said they recorded overwatch, which I think is great, but **WHY** did they need to tell the people they think are hackers? That gives them a warning to turn them off straight away.Cheers"

And how can I help him?,"Hey all.Not really sure where to start so I'll just start here - _PERSON_ used to be insanely fit and active when he was around my age (I know this from pictures, stories, etc), and until about 3 years ago, I was too. I then had issues with depression and got tubby (_PERSON_, 6""4, now down to 16 Stone). _PERSON_ has been large for *my* entire life, but in the last few years has become a lot heavier. Judging by our similar height I would guess he is maybe 25 Stone. I hate to say it, but he's the largest person I know personally.He needs to lose weight, he knows this, but he needs to be kicked into gear.I do know about healthy eating, proper exercise, etc, and I'm sure he does too so that's not really an issue. The issue is how I tell him something needs to be done and soon.As he has had hip operations on both hips, I don't think running would be best for him. I'm an avid _PERSON_ and thought maybe I could get him out doing some trails with me, but as I only ride Downhill I don't have a Cross Country/Road bike. He has an old one but I'm not sure it's the correct height for him.How would you guys suggest I go about telling him, and then helping him? I need to lose weight/gain muscle at the same time so something with that?We have a very good relationship, but he can get a little hostile sometimes.If you want any more info I can provide it._PERSON_**tl;dr**: Dad is very overweight.

My friends here are cool people, but hanging out with them has become really few and far between.Reddit, I'm BORED. I know that there are more serious things happening out there.

2ltin9,12083,SuicideWatch,1415585835,I'm close to making my second attempt [m 22],"I don't really know how to open this letter.By all marks, measures, and standards I live a pretty good life. My family lived the ""American Dream"" going from rags to upper-middle class riches; and I'm already primed to go even further than that. I have a huge family circle, and 7 really close friends. I have my own place, own my car, make very good money, do close to the job I've wanted since I was a teenager. Hell, I almost have enough in the bank to pay off my student loans and I just graduated in May.But it means piss all.It might not make sense, but none of these things mean anything to me. They are all items, people, and futures for somebody else.I'm completely alone in the universe. Everything I have, Everybody I know, is connected to a fake identity I created after my first (obviously failed) attempt.The only person who knows a part of who I actually am is my _PERSON_ (whom I left when I moved away from college).Dealing with these feelings was easier in college because I didn't have any real responsibilities. I'm smart enough to coast through most classes while asleep, and I can earn any amount of money any time I want using my skills (I'm a very in demand programmer).But now it's not nearly as easy. I've lost my friends to various parts of the country. Lost my family to their's and my time and schedules. And I threw away the best person in my life because the physical distance between us was too much.The reason I'm writing this is because today my _PERSON_ came over to see me. We're still best friends after the breakup and I've admitted to still having feelings for her, but I looked into her eyes and there were only dead coals where her love for me used to shine.She had completely moved on and nothing was left.It was the last straw. I was a camel trudging my way through an endless desert with a mountain of cargo 10 years tall and that was the final feather that caused me to buckle.One of the last two people in the world I cared for no longer cared about me.The only reason I'm here writing this instead of drowning myself or OD'ing on sleeping pills is because it would destroy my mother if I died. But I think that excuse will really only last for so long."

Now, busted 2 wasn't really busted, it just never had internet. After being guaranteed by my professor, and the other network guys in the class that it was plugged into the network I decided to take a look at the connections.

My age is irrelevent because I've met 18 year olds and 60 year olds with the same life experiences. All of my life I have simply wanted to be good person a good man.  I wanted to be a loving father a good husband. I love everyone but it has become harder to do so.  Through the years ive had pleanty of great experiences and pleanty of bad ones. My two yolder ex step brothers used to molest each other daily force me to watch, to join in. Ive seen the deterioration of my family from unstable parents who would jump from hone horrendous partner to the next. At times ive been blamed for the downfall of a few simply because I was shocked at how they acted and my lack of suprise in there ending. At 13 its sad to hear that your  the reason your father acts out or is deppresed.  One of my parents have finally latched on to a religious zealot of a person. Never before had my family been religious untill they met.I am appalled at the shear audacity and hatred ""loving cristians"" can have towards one another especially there family. My sisters have become devoted followers  and I have been ostrisized for not blindly excepting there faith. To give you some example my sister was pregnant before marriage because of this my parents didnt talk to her didnt let my other younger sisters talk or see her. She eventually got married and to the man so they began to speak with her again. When the man started to abuse her cheat on her and get her intoxicated to film her she had decided to leave him. My parents and there church made it clear that agian she would lose her ties with them and she couldnt do it. Unfortunately they are still together trying for 5 kids.I have recently been engaged. She left me 1 month before the wedding. Ive never felt so alone until then.I have attempted suicide before and through my fails I have learned to perfect the act.Through my deppresion and self loathing I have developed a hate for people and I cannot do it anymore.Now I already have the day chosen and the means in wich I will do it. Ive already started the steps for this. I write this today not for me but for anyone elce. Ive been alone my whole life and through my lonlieness I have sought suicide and will forever be lonepy no more. It is my hope that this can some how be not necessarily a saving light for some but more as a way that they will not feel alone.  Again though it is harder I still love you all."

At this time my loving parents decide that im an adult and dont need help kicking me out.I was homeless for a week living out of my car I had stopped being happy anymore life was becoming a daily struggle. In that week of being homeless I was so ashamed of not showering for four days I missed a consecutive 4 days of work. Disqualifying me of any over time. Cutting my checks in halve.I finally found a place to stay at for a couple of weeks. My friend I stayed wiyh introduced me to what is now a daily routine. Opiate addictiong does wonders to deppresion but you will never be more addicted to anything when used to combat deppresion.On the last night with my new found friend my old best friend decided to send me pictures of my now ex feionce making out with a dude and super happy. I guess loss hadnt fully set in untill that moment. I started driving anywhere everywhere crying. I saw this stop sign and I saw this brand new tahoe turning left and I just floored it. I was able to get to 63 before tboning the other car. I broke a rib and knocked myself out. When I came to in the hospital bed I cried at the simple fact I was still there.On an impulse I bought a brand new mustang in some hope I would get some enjoyment some feeling from the new car. Nothing hollow. I was now staying with my aunt qith a deadline of two months to move out. From a perfect combination of buying drugs to smoking two packs a day and wasting all money in hope of some relief I spent all money I had from a check before the week was finished. I have made no car payments I do not have insurance I still have paper tag.And then we come on today. I had to leave my aunts house. I am now homeless again. I am required to surrender my car in two days. I do not have the money for enough drugs to get me high. Ive reached out to any friend with no response. I am now sitting in a wallmart parking lot. With just enough money to buy something to kill myself. And I want to cally ex feionce. I am at zero

I've posted occasionly and my last 6 months I've posted on here in my 60 to 0 in 6 months post.  I have decided tomorrow will be it.  2 days before Christmas 20 before my birthday.  I have nothing special planned no outpouring of love no trying to rekindle past loves.  I will eat a gyro I will go to work I will go see a movie come home and do it. I just wanna tell anyone who has tried to help me thank you.  You simply deserve more then my family has.goodbye
1uqgjw,35898,depression,1389211294,I'm 21 next week. And i just had my third failed suicide attempt.,I don't know what to do.  I simply don't want to see my birthday.  Disowned by my family and the best friends who have saved my life twice.  They say they can't see me destroy my life.  They just think I want to see it burn.  They don't understand. It's become hard to breath fresh air it has become stale In my depression.  I had one love intrest a good friend of mine for 7 months who's married.  We had sex yesterday it wad the best sex I've ever had.  And I was eternally and whole heartily I love with her.  Today she turns down my kiss and tells me we will only be friends.  I've tried pills.  Wrecking my car.  And pills with alcohol I've been stopped or saved at every attempt.  My final attempt will be with a gun.  I know where my dad keeps it. It would be easy. If don't know if I will.  But I'm leaning very heavily towards it.  My emotions are crushing me.

1qq4iu,3260,legaladvice,1384557275,My father passed away; what happens to/who owns the books that he wrote? Copyright question.,"Location: New Hampshire.My father passed away in 2007. I am his only living descendant. After his death, there was a big stink in probate that his brother made, because he thought there was money tucked in a bank somewhere. There wasn't. However, his brother (my uncle) was appointed temporary executor of the estate. After going back and forth a couple states away to probate court, I gave up. It was no longer worth my time. I have no idea what happened to the case.He wrote a few books. A couple of them are currently in publication, however sales are more or less nonexistant.I'm curious what happens to these publications? Obviously, they're protected by copyright until 70 years after his death (2077), however if I wanted to, lets say, revise or republish them, am I allowed to do so, being his only heir/descendant?EDIT: I also want to add that there are a few manuscripts that aren't published yet at all."

1r6qde,3260,Psychonaut,1385085706,"Found this rambling in an old text file. Don't remember writing it, but wanted to share.","there are over one hundred billion galaxies in the universe. probably over five hundred billion. think about how high of a number that is. 500,000,000,000. each one of those galaxies has an estimated two hundred billion stars - many of which are yellow dwarfs just like our own sun. orbiting a high percentage of these stars are planets, many with moons. there are an estimated five hundred billion galaxies in the universe. each one of these galaxies has an estimated two hundred billion stars. if we assume one percent of those stars have eight planets, like our sun, and that one of those has habitable conditions similar to earth, that gives us an estimated one sextillion (1000000000000000000000) planets. if each planet were the size of a penny, all stacked neatly, they would make a cube 50 MILES on each side. statistically speaking, it is next to impossible that we are not the only planet with intelligent life. if one percent of those habitable planets had intelligent life, there would be one quintillion (10000000000000000000 [only a 5.2 mile cube of pennies!]) planets of people looking up at the night sky, wondering if anyone else is out there. or maybe they know that we are, or that somebody is - there's a pretty high probability of it.if each one of those one quintillion planets with intelligent life on it has a population of five billion (the population of earth in 1987), then there are, in our little scenario, roughly fifty octillion (50000000000000000000000000000) intelligent individuals in what we are calling the universe.you are one of them. one person on one planet in one star system in one galaxy out of an incomprehensibly large number of galaxies. in one hundred years, you will die. what is in your bank account, what you drove, where you worked, what you thought, if you were fat or skinny, black or white, whether you had bad teeth or were missing an arm - none of it will matter. in two hundred years no one will be alive that has a memory of you directly. in five hundred years it is safe to say that, unless you make some monumental acheivement in some field, all mention of you, including post-mortem memorials, will be gone forever. in ten thousand years human beings as we know them will be twice as old, as a species, as they are now. in fifty thousand years it is predicted that the next ice age will begin. our planet will be drastically changed and if humans are still present on the planet, it is likely that the majority will not survive. in two hundred fifty million years, all the land masses of earth will have assembled back into a super-continent. in five billion years the sun will run out of hydrogen and expand, most likely engulfing and completely destroying this world. inevitably, every single thing about you, around you, in the same city, state, country, continent, and planet (and beyond) that you know will be completely and utterly destroyed.the only thing that you can do that matters during your extremely limited time here is whatever matters to YOU. if you want to laugh, laugh. if you feel love, then love. live in the city, live alone in the mountains. have a cat. grow your hair long. get a tattoo. get a new car. smoke pot. drink. run. swim. love. look at things you've never seen before. go down that road you drive by every day but have never been down. start looking under things you've never looked under and open doors you've never been through (in both a literal and metaphorical sense). you live once (as far as we can tell) and for fuck's sake, enjoy it. do what makes you happy because once you're done, you can't go back and change your mind. you, like the other fifty octillion people out there, are not permanant. nothing is. you are the same decaying organic matter as every single other thing in the universe. complex chemical reactions. hydrogen questioning it's own existance. you are not what you own. you are not who you think you are. you know nothing about most things that you interact with on a daily basis.i hope you took the time to read this and really sit down and think about it. let it soak in. it's a lot to understand and no one can completely comprehend and accept it, but we try.so next time you're outside and it's a clear night, i ask you to take five minutes out of your life and sit down, or lay down, or just stand there like an idiot and look upwards. let your eyes adjust to the low light and look at all those little tiny dots that you've always seen in your peripheral vision but have never really thought about until now. there are hundreds of them that you can see with the naked eye, given time. thousands, even. thousands of billions you cannot see. if the light from all of them was visible, they would fill the night sky and it would be just as bright as day.somewhere, quite far away but closer than you may think, is someone else. they do not look like you or talk like you, but chances are they're thinking the same thing you are. ""am i alone?""never."

But lately I feel like I'm very slowly coming to terms with it. It's weird. Lately everything has felt very... grey. I'm really tired of it all. I'm tired of being tired. I'm starting to regret life choices and not bad ones - my life really isn't in that bad of a place right now. Decent job. Going to get married in May. Hopefully buy a house next year sometime.

2d6pqn,3260,r4r,1407713745,29 [M4R] NYC - Someone to get to know,"So I'm pushing 30, and it feels super weird. My knees are starting to hurt a little. No one told me that would start to happen so soon! It sucks.Sorry if I get a little wordy here, I haven't sat down to write anything like this in a really long time..I've been having a very difficult time with everyone else in the world lately. Literally, every single person, no joke. And it's because over the past eighteen months or so, I'm realizing that every single person I walk past every day, and everyone that makes my coffee, and the crazy motherfucker who sits outside _PERSON_ station and does karate at the air in front of him, all of them are just as deep and complex and multifaceted as I am. It's really weirding me out. It's like the moment of brief epiphany you get randomly that one day you will, in fact, die. But the difference is unlike the death thing, this doesn't go away in a minute or two - this has been dragging on .I feel as if a wall that were always in front of me just turned opaque all of a sudden. These people that are entering and exiting my life - most only taking stage for less than five seconds - in the daily shuffle of the city are so much more than just ""a bunch of strangers around me"". It's ""a bunch of *individuals* around me"". People who have jobs and family and who love other people just as much as I love the people in my life. People whose eyes all wander up once in a while at the night sky and wonder what's out there. People who brush their teeth every day, who kick the coffee table in the middle of the night, who have awful diarrhea sometimes, just people who are almost exactly like me.It's a lot to process. I don't want it to seem like I was some pseudo-sociopathic person who felt nothing at all for everyone else. Its just that I feel like I've been living too... selfishly. Too living-for-me, if that makes sense.I have no idea how I was originally planning on tying this in with an r4r post.One of my favorite movies is ""Lost in Translation"". If you have not seen it, I highly suggest you do so. It's not on _PERSON_, but you can rent it for like two bucks on Amazon Prime video, or just torrent it for free. If you have seen it, maybe you know what I'm talking about when I say that I find the over-bearingly lost feeling - emotionally - was captured amazingly. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ both do an excellent job portraying people who are questioning themselves and their loved ones. I don't really feel my words can do it justice, to be honest; I'm no seasoned film critic.But that's what I guess I'm looking for with this post. I don't live in NYC, but I do travel here every couple of months for work. I'm feeling quite lost at home, and in this world. I haven't felt this existential since I was 16. I'd love to find someone who understands where I'm coming from, and wants to spend a few days out of the year enjoying the company of another person, doing whatever is enjoyable. I know the city decently well, but not enough to know any of the small, tucked-away wonders.Maybe you're out there, and in a similar situation. Perhaps life has you down, for one reason or another. I'd love to hear about it, I feel like I haven't sat down and had an honest-to-god real, deep conversation with another person in over ten years. Everything in my life right now has become overly familiar and comfortable, to the point that its getting uncomfortable. EDIIT: as an afterthought,[ if you've ever listened to ""Touch"" by Daft Punk](_URL_ I feel its somehow relateable to how I've been feeling lately.This is open to anyone, male or female.I'd love to get a drink, smoke a joint, get food, or coffee, or go for a walk, or just share a fifteen minute conversation on the train.

I don't have a dollar to my name, no skills, and frankly it just doesn't seem like I have any options. I don't remember the last time I was happy, and I don't see happiness in my future.

I know we have to make a fire to scare whatever it is, so I begin to gather firewood and beg my friend to help, but she won't. She just kind of stands there and keeps saying ""Relax, its probably nothing"" and stuff like that. I finally have some wood and try to start the fire but my lighter won't start. The the rusting stops. I look up and I see a dark shape (I couldn't exactly make it out but it seemed like a mountain lion maybe?) emerge from the treeline, growling and walking straight towards me. Then suddenly there is a light and I turn around and see two more people I know had arrived from the path. There arrival had scared the animal back into the treeline, but I could here it pacing and growling, waiting. I beg my friends to help me light the fire so we can be safe, but they won't listen to me. They say that they are gonna begin walking back, and I know our only choice is to go with them, or be eaten. We begin walking back. I can see where the road opens up waaaay in the distance, and as we walk I can see a shape moving. I can see the outline of a person hanging from a tree right over the path, flailing. I look up and a round and begin to notice there were many people hanging from the trees around me. It was dark and I can just see their figures dangling. I look up to my left and right above me I see the figure of a man in the tree, sitting on a branch. I can see he has a rope tied to his neck, but the worst thing were his red eyes. He drops himself off the branch screaming as he falls towards me.

21vwu0,32828,offmychest,1396318528,I wish my family would die,"I was the product of a one-night-stand, and my father has never been a part of my life. My mother has always treated me differently than my half-siblings. Ever since I was very young, I was told everything I did was wrong. My mother would always tell me things like: ""Why is it always you?"", ""What did I do to deserve you?"", ""You're worthless"", ""You are the reason why our family never gets along."" etc. I am blamed ruthlessly for any and everything that goes wrong, no matter how small. My siblings have always loved to take advantage of this. No matter how bad something was all anybody in my house has to do to get out of trouble is just mention my name. If anything goes wrong at all the first thing said will without a doubt be ""_PERSON_ did it."" No matter what my excuse is, or how much evidence I have to prove otherwise, they won't listen. It gets ridiculous sometimes; like the time I stole a bottle of alcohol from my step-dad's office.... While I was out of state visiting family.I was always where my family vented their emotions. I dreaded when I heard my mother and step-father fighting, because that meant one or both would be upon me soon. My step-father is worse than my mother in many sorts. Even though he has been with my mother since I was 3 years old, he has always reminded me I was not his child. He reminds me of a jealous child when he speaks, he always talks about how everything I do is wrong, and he was always very vocal about how I was nothing but a burden on their family. He is 6'6'', 300 lbs former-football player. To this day, I have never seen him lay a hand on another child but me. My youngest sibling is 15 years old, and in those fifteen years I have NEVER seen him lay hands on him ONCE. I can recall 'taking' beatings for my siblings. They would do something wrong, my parents would watch them do it, but the turn around and hit me instead.I hate my siblings for all the pain and suffering they put me through, but I'm torn because I know that is just how they were raised. I remember when my youngest brother was a baby just learning how to speak, my older sister would hold him and tell him to say things to me like ""You're _PERSON_!"" or ""You're so ugly"". I literally had to do anything my siblings asked or they would just tell my parents I said something nasty about them, or I pushed them. Making fun of me was how they bonded.Now for my confession; I want my ''parents'' to die. I really do. No if, ands or buts. I have fantasized about it since I was a kid. The anger and hate that has developed inside of me scares me. I get *happy* from thinking about buying a gun and blowing their brains out. Sometimes when I'm feeling low, that thought is what *cheers me up*. They made me something so broken and twisted and incapable of having a normal relationship. Years of therapy haven't helped. I don't think anything will. One day, when I can, I am going to leave this god-forsaken town and never have to see any of their faces again. I only hope that it isn't in a squad car."

I have never felt a connection with any other dude the way I feel with him, we just click. He is one of the only people I know whose company I can't get tired of. We've know each other for about 5 years, having met Sophomore year of HS, and have been good friends for most of that time. But we tend to got through phases of him being really close with me and then... not. Sometime we'll hang out every day for weeks at a time, then he'll suddenly cut me from his life for a few weeks. It's hard to explain, but I feel like he intentionally likes to remind me that I'm not that important to him. Little things like: He will not respond to calls or texts. He will 'forget' to invite me to parties. A couple weeks ago he called and said he was going to come over to my house because he had a couple hours to kill before a meeting, then texted me two hours later to say that he went to another one of his friends houses instead.... Ok, how am I supposed to respond to that? Since we have been friends so long we have lots of mutual friends, and it just bothers me because I get to see first hand how he remembers to invite them to parties, how he snapchats them back, how he answers their calls (He even calls them!). Its small things, but it doesn't seem like coincidence. It seems like he doesn't like me. At all. And it hurts because honestly he's my best friend, but I feel like I'm nothing to him. I've brought my feelings about his attitude towards me up before, and he always insists he doesn't know what I'm talking about and says I'm just too sensitive, but It just seems like his behavior is just so blatant.I've never had a one-sided heterosexual relationship with another guy, and I really don't know how to handle it."

I love your state! Great food, great people, and beautiful country. I happily call Texas my second home.But I *do* have one bone to pick.Over the years I've gotten A LOT of hate in Texas over the simple fact that I'm from California. Most Texans I meet are friendly, hospitable folks, but I've seen that hospitality shift pretty quickly once I mention my birth place. Some people's expression will *literally* change to one of disapproval. Texans seem to have gotten it in their heads that there is some rivalry/bad blood between our two states, and frankly, I think that's silly. I've asked over the years to Texas friends who dislike California/ians why, and the answers have ranged from everything from our driving, our ""smugness"", our politics, and (especially) our basketball team. I've gotten more than one ""Well, ya'll make fun of us!"".But, I have some news: no we don't! In fact, I've never heard anyone in California speak Ill of Texans or Texas (except your police, who seem to have a fetish for California plates haha). Texans have no ""reputation"" here to begin with. I think the attitude difference stems from the pride Texans have of their state. Texans *LOVE* Texas, where as most Californians don't really have strong feeling for our state. To give you and example of the different attitude, I'm just going to say this: Though I have lived in California for 23 years, I have never seen a California flag hoisted outside of a school or public building. Not once. (Though I admit I have seen it on bumper stickers/sweaters/hats). Where as any Texan can look out their window and see at least one state flag. I wouldnt say its unfair to say texas flags outnumber u.s. flags in the sate 3-1. It's OK to have some pride in your state, but too much pride can lead to arrogance, jealousy, and poor behavior to guests who go out of their way to spend time and money in your wonderful state.Anyway this post got wayyy out of hand, and I'm bored writing. I hope I didn't offend anyone, it was not my intention.Tl;dr: People are people, states are states, and pride can be bad, mmkay?"
2yxyor,32828,INTP,1426275704,I need some love advice (INTP),"I (intp, male, 21) have been in love with my close friend (infp, male, 21) for years. We have been almost inseparable since we met 6 years ago. Before I met ""_PERSON_"" I was angry loner who thought the world was full stupid assholes. I didnt believe in love. I felt alone and depressed. Then I met him, and everything changed. I had a friend finally. He helped me climb out of my shell and helped make me the person I am today.But, unfortunately, I fell in love. It's unbearable. I have never confessed my love to him per se, but I think my behavior/actions speak clearly (I can express my emotions, just not with words, if that makes sense haha). _PERSON_ has also implied he isn't interested, but I get the feeling that isn't entirely so. It seems to me not that he doesn't love me, but that he doesn't *want to*. Even though we usually hang out everyday, every now and then he goes awol and wont talk to me for weeks or months at a time (usually just me, not other friends or family). If i do manage to get ahold of him during these time he will act cold and cruel towards me, and if I ask him about his change in attitude he will swear there's nothing going on, then accuse me of being too needy/controlling. Last Saturday he called after work and asked me if i wanted to go to a friends house about an hour away for some drinks, and I said of course. He picks me up, we head out and have a great night. I end up crashing on my friends couch around 3 AM, and when I wake up around 8, _PERSON_ is gone. I take the bus home, kind of upset honestly. He doesn't call or text me, so I call him on Wednesday, no response. He calls me late last night and even though I was kinda upset still, I was happy to hear from him. But he was very blunt in explaining to me his dads water heater went out and he wanted me to look at it (I'm a plumber). I kinda lost my cool a little and asked him why he left me at our friends house and why he hasn't been around, and he told me ""You aren't my fucking girlfriend and I don't have to tell you anything"" and hung up. That hurt.  A lot. But he is right I guess.Then this morning a mutual friend of ours came over and told me that on Wednesday he had run into _PERSON_, and that _PERSON_ had told him he was going through a tough spot emotionally, and he was worried about him, and expected me to know what was going on since I'm his best friend, but franky hadn't mentioned anything to me. This leads me to believe that 1: Something IS going on with him 2: It's eating him up enough to tell someone (he never shares his feelings)3: It involves me (otherwise why would he be ignoring me, or choose to tell a less-close friend?)Part of me thinks he is trying to fight feelings for me, but maybe my emotions are clouding my judgement, making read between lines that aren't there. Maybe I really am needy and controlling... I can't tell. But if he doesn't want to be in love with me, does it even matter? If we part ways I lose my best friend, if I stay, I will not be able to get over him... I don't know what to do. Sorry for rambling, I needed to vent._PERSON_: EMOTION PROCESS:FAILED"

My vision goes completely black and I start seeing flashing spots everywhere.

This is a long rant but I feel so angry and I feel sorry for the vulnerable people that actually get forced into this scan.  They are the most disgusting companies I've ever experienced. The guy was so helpful at first, told me it was a ""software"" problem and since I haven't got that kind of cover, to get it fixed I need their software cover. I asked how much it was and he said £93.00 for a year. I told him I couldn't afford that at the moment and he said I could give him my details now and then ring my bank on Monday to ask for them to stop the payment in full but ask for it to be spread into monthly payments (is that even possible?!) he kept pushing me to buy it. I told him I didn't have my purse anyway as my boyfriends been doing my shopping as I haven't been well to go out, he told me to give him my boyfriends number and he will ring him to get my card details, I told him he was at work, he kept saying for me to give him his number and he will ring him. I said no and then he said he had already started the transaction so if I don't pay it will come out of his own account. He was trying to blackmail me into giving him money. I told him I didn't agree to it and he kept saying if I don't pay he will have to as I sounded like I wanted it so he set up the transaction and so I should ring my boyfriend to get payment. In the end I just told him sternly that I have not agreed to anything therefor I'm not in a contract. Eventually after this going on of him trying to force me to pay he finally got the idea and gave up. I hear you ask why I didn't just hang up on him already. I didn't because he had control of my computer, on his server. If I hung up he could of done anything he wanted. I found out afterwards there was a Red Cross I could of pressed to cancel the control but he never told me that. RANT OVER."
2ss6fb,450,lupus,1421539382,Anyone here with lupus anticoagulant? Have you had a successful pregnancy?,"Hello all, just wondering if anyone with lupus SLE and anticoagulant (sometimes called antipholisiphids syndrome I think?) had a successful pregnancy? I got diagnosed when I was 16 (25 now) and my doctors have ALWAYS fobbed me off, I used to see my rheumy every 6 months for blood tests and check ups but he stopped that two years ago saying my ANA was staying the same level and if I get a flare up to just go to the doctor to get steroids temporarily. Well last year I got pregnant so I went to my doctors straight away as my rheumy told me I would need blood thinner injections. My doctor fobbed me off and told me I would be fine until my first scan. I knew it wasn't right, I rang up the hospital, begging to be seen to sooner. Nothing. Two weeks later I miscarried (it was a horrific experience, the nurses didn't have a clue and even denied I was pregnant  because she read test wrong). It's pretty much scarred me for wanting to try again and I don't know what to do, I've lost faith completely with my doctor and I need advice on what I should do if I ever do try again. Thank you"

Is there anything I can say to change his mind?  I've begged him to go to the doctors but he has no faith in them. I've begged him to speak to his dad but he said he can't. I'm scared of losing him, I'm scared of it turning my family upside down, I'm scared it will break my uncle and aunties heart and I'm terrified that I will live with the guilt that I could of done more. He might not even do it, I hope he doesn't. I guess I just needed to speak my mind to strangers."

Plus, what lady in her right mind would want to go from having hair halfway down her back to not much at all? Do any of you have experiences with hair follicle tests?

Ever since that relationship almost three years ago, my subsequent relationships have been really, really, fucked up and unsuccessful. I also find myself reading into behaviors of whoever I'm seeing.I was feeling a little better a year ago about relationships and decided to start dating someone. A few months later I was stuck in an abusive situation, and upon getting out of it I discovered that every girl that man had ever dated had been diagnosed with some sort of mental illness, and one of them actually committed suicide as a result of a relationship with him.Thankfully at that point I was on lots of medication and knew better than to do anything stupid.But it still fucks with me, and now I've been seeing someone since February and I really enjoy his company, and want to be in a relationship with him, but sometimes he won't talk to me for days at a time even if I try to just say hello, and then he will come over and we will have a wonderful time, and my only thought right now is that he's using me, or he's gotten tired of me, just like everyone else.  I feel my friends, platonic and romantic, in the past have always just gotten tired of me and thrown me away, even though I recognize that sometimes I pushed them away to ""test"" them and see who was worth having around. But with this one I haven't done that at all.  I have been nothing but happy and feeling ready, finally, for a relationship, but I don't know what's going on and I can't help but feel like it's my fault that I'm not interesting enough."

However, every time I have sex, I spend the next few days on my phone researching the percentage of failure in using both condoms and the pill correctly. I know the information is never going to change, but I just can't stop reading about it until either my mind is put at ease or I'm left stressing about whether or not my period is going to come. I should also point out that, according to the things I've read, smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol decreases fertility. I'm doing my best to quit smoking (though I smoked a pack over the weekend) and I drink socially. I also have extremely poor eating habits (less than 1000-1200 calories a day) and a physically demanding job at which I have at least 60 minutes of cardio a day (often more). These things are also known to decrease fertility. I'm 23 and never want children. I know that abstinence is the only 100% reliable form of birth control, but does the world expect me to never have sex? I also know it isn't normal to obsess over this. I just have bad anxiety."

After scouting around a bit (visiting local FDNY firehouses, talking to EMTs, etc.), I've decided my best bet would be to start at my local volunteer ambulance corps. Considering my age, the only available job would be to start as a dispatcher (intercept local radio, receive/handle calls, dispatch ambulances, and so forth). Though I don't start training for a bit, I would still like to know, what should I expect? Is there anything I should/could study for? Also, once I hit 18 or so, how could I transition into a job such as an EMT/FDNY paramedic?Any/all help is greatly appreciated!"

Hell, if anyone remembers, I used to constantly post here regarding sliding and such. So, aside from school and snow, I really haven't been able to skate much because of this dumb thing called plantar fasciitis, which is basically the inflammation of the bottom of your foot (feet in my case). I just recently started to recover from it, after months of constant foot pain. What I've realized, however, is that I'm fine riding about 3-4 miles at a time, but as soon as I get off the board, it kills trying to stand/walk. Does anyone have any advice on this? Perhaps you've had plantar fasciitis or another foot injury, and you have some tips on recovery?Thanks in advance for any help!"

Its even affecting my sexual function. Im not able to get hard hard like i once was. I don't shoot out like i once did, nor do i produce as much as i used to.

I listed off some of the least controversial ones: women bear children, men tend to be stronger, the potential costs of sex are much much higher to women, women are the gatekeepers of sex, women tend to be more risk averse, men are  overwhelmingly attracted to youth and fertility, women are overwhelmingly attracted to wealth, social dominance and status.    She said the majority of that is sexist bullshit.Now I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel here.   I don't have an infinite amount of time and patience to debate this from my personal POV.  Can anyone point to some good resources that clearly and concisely explain gender roles/differences that wouldn't be offputting to a BPer?"

This claim is often used to convince folks to choose life. This of course ignores the fact that people kill themselves for an infinite variety of reasons. While it is obvious that some suicides can be considered more irrational than others ( _PERSON_, for example, ostensibly had a much better life by virtually any measure than millions of people on earth who never choose suicide), can we say that suicide is any less rational than sexual relations, love, reproduction or the choice to live in general? I would argue that suicide is no more or less rational than living itself."

Of course unlike Tribes it would not be unlimited. It would use a second bar that can be improved (of course) with _PERSON_. That way it would be kept at bay and not abused or _PERSON_. Perhaps it could even couple with a cosmetic slot. Special boots that allow it and only very short flight times. Enough to start you off but not enough to send you from Crossroads to Crown.

So, here they are:1.VS Drop podsInstead of an actual pod, make us shoot down in a beam of light/laser and materialize on the ground. You can still steer the laser/light like normal and it would take the same amount of time as it does now. Perhaps we could even land crouching to give us that cool look.2.TR  Drop podsThe current ones are perfect for the TR really, but it would be unfair to leave them out. So how about a cone shaped pod with a red glass side that flips down to let you out. Kinda like an upside down Mosquito cockpit. Sorry, not too creative but lemme know what you think.3.NC Drop pods.Here's where it gets a *little* silly. Due to the NC equipment and vehicles looking rather boxy, my brother suggested a simple crate drop and you crawl out. While funny, kinda unfair and not real practical. So, what about a rounded rectangle with a yellow glass side and twin rockets on the back. Again, not very good.

They would kinda look like small sledgehammers. Small amount of splash damage and 3-4 hits to kill.For the NCA HUGE Sledgehammer that is OHK but very small splash damage and slow to use. About 1 sec in between hits. Makes large dents in tanks...For the VSA hammer similar to the Gravity Hammer in Halo. Has a 1.4 delay between slams. Sends enemies flying 8-10 metres but only takes out your shield.

1mgmqq,25040,offmychest,1379286552,I feel like I have nothing to live for.,"I do online study and recently I submitted a work unit of what I thought was my own work. Turns out that it was a friends that I got mixed up and TAFE wasn't happy. So I will have to buy it again but that's not what I'm upset about.My mother was even more upset. It was a mistake but she was saying that now I'm known as a cheater to the entire TAFE. She went off the deep end.A little back story: The PC is my life. More specifically, the IT industry. So I like to game, who doesn't? My parents for one. Anyway, I like to tinker with my PC as a hobby using savings that I have put away for the PC only. I put about $5 a week in it. I have had a wishlist on PCCaseGear that I was slowly saving for. Now my ""punishment"" for ""cheating"" is that I may no longer upgrade or tinker with my PC.I'm pretty sure that my life will get taken away tonight when my father gets home. They hate computers with a passion and my PC has been hanging by a thread for the past 6 months. Tonight I fear it will go.I don't like the word ""addicted"". I have a passion for computers and technology in general. I get very engrossed in them and my family does not understand as none of them possess the knowledge or passion of technology.It's my whole life. I have no IRL friends, so I turned to playing online. Only to be shutdown by my parents saying ""there could be a weirdo posing as a kid"" and ""They aren't really friends, just people you have randomly met"" and ""It's not healthy to try have online friends"".I'm a social disaster. Apparently I act strange, but it seems normal for me. I'm a very submissive person so I get walked on a lot. Normally I just take it, but today I feel defeated. WHAT ELSE HAVE I GOT????. NOTHING. I just want to end it all and I feel like I have 2 choices. I need transport to the other side of the city and 500,000 to start a *whole* new life. Or, I need something fatal. I don't know which and I really think I'm not brave enough for option 2.What the hay do I do? Live on and try not to completely crack when my life goes? Find a cliff/car/gun/rope and live forever happily? Yes, I'm a Christian. That makes this even worse as I'm not sure if I should even be thinking this.I have a job, a casual position at Target but I have no friends there and it's become once a week for 4 hours. When I come home, there is nothing for me. It's bad enough that I'm only allowed any interaction with my PC for 7 hours each Friday. That was very hard to take but I did it. The idea of it being gone forever is too hard though. A lot of tears while writing this.Just, what do I do? Am I being selfish and addicted? I don't know anymore and suicide is big on my mind. If I can pull it off though? I don't know, and that scares me as it means I'll have to live a wreak.I want to tell my parents this, but all hell would break loose and I would be better off dead.

Here's a small review.","I won't go into box details as that's boring, however the contents of the box are as follows: 3 sets of buds for different ear sizes + _PERSON_ already on the earbuds, small flat circular carry case with a fabric pocket for the extra buds, quick start booklet, warranty pamphlet and clear Razer case sticker.I'll be comparing these to my Turtle Beach X12s which cost similar.First off, comfort. The Hammerheads fit very well into my ears and sat firmly with no slipping. For the real thump of the bass, you may need to hold them in. Or maybe that's just me. If you have glasses, like me, they are probably a slightly better option over the X12s but not by much. The X12s are surprisingly comfortable with glasses too.Sound quality is almost as good as the X12s but they sound the tiniest bit muffled. It's hardly noticeable though. All the frequencies my Nexus 4 could play came though loud and clear with no fuzzyness or muddle._PERSON_ is much better than the X12s. Probably due to them being right in your ear. They thump astoundingly well and it's quite satisfying. The X12's have a good oomph, but somehow not quite as much as the Hammerheads.Overall, the X12s are slightly better in quality but the Hammerheads win on bass. Unlike the X12s too, there is virtually no sound leakage even when held in your hand with full volume. The X12s tend to leak a bit when you do that and some when they are on. Build quality is par with both.Hope this helps your division to get a pair of Hammerheads. If I missed anything, just ask :)"

It pretty much describes my life as of now. I originally posted this in an Askreddit thread, but omitted a vital detail due to not wanting to start an argument. I'm a Christian. Which makes it worse. I have a strong addiction to computers, so strong I can almost faintly feel a physical bond between it and I. If anyone gets between that, I get very hostile and upset to the point of breaking good down completely. The main problem is gaming my life away. A few others are wanting friendship, freedom, and removing myself from my turmoils life. You might say that it's normal, especially for a 17 year old male. But when it gets to the point that I completely fail a college course, you know it's bad. Why? I was gaming and the teacher gave me 30 min to correct the test and I simply said that I'm not near a PC. To make that worse, I had accidentally submitted another students work as he sent it to me for studying so I could better know what the course required. So the college pretty much saw me as a cheat, and further supporting that is the fact that I refused to try fix it. I have also been struggling with, um, fapping for well over 5 years. I feel horrible everytime I do it but I can't stop. The temptation is too great. I tell myself that I'll feel better after, but it's just a huge lie I tell myself. I finally talked to my dad about it, but that seemed to make it worse. He was forgiving, but disappointed. I spun a web of lies and deceit throughout the whole year about gaming and my PC. It all finally came out a few weeks ago, but I don't feel any better. The punishment was removal of my laptop and PC for an indefinite amount of time. So you can imagine how I feel as my computers were/are a gateway to friends and a better place. My whole life for the past 6-7 years has been a mess. I just want it to end, maybe when I'm 18 it will. Recently though, I've been close to suicide. My parents seem to brush it off as if I don't know what I'm talking about and that my life is okay, you just need time to iron it out. It's been so long though, I think I would have sorted it all out some time ago. I've been in the kitchen in the wee hours of the morning, holding a knife ready to take it all away. I think the only reasons I haven't, is that it would be selfish and my family would miss me, and that I'm afraid. I don't know what will come after for sure. So I have continued to plod it out, hoping that the newt day will be better. But it never is. I either fall into depression over my lost computers, or fap in the shower. I'm so sick of it all. I'm gonna get some sleep now, but I'll be back in the morning. I'd appreciate any support I can get. TL;DR: I'm a horrible, horrible person with a worse life. And I claim that I'm okay."

The new episodes are downloadable 30 minutes after they air and have thousands of hits on YouTube. Is it just me and my blind loyalty, or is the Bronie Community the only community that goes this far? I have never seen anything like it. You don't see new movies out on YouTube just a few hours after the hit the big screen, why was _PERSON_ any different? I'm guilty of it too, as I have downloaded all of the previous 3 seasons and am starting on the 4th. I have just realised that it's much bigger than anything I've seenIs it just me? Is this normal for most fandoms? I just don't want MLP to lose money and thus the whole show because of our pirating. Any other views?E: Thanks guys, I have a broader view now.

1sg4fq,25040,pcmasterrace,1386571892,I saved my brother from peasantry.,"A while back I was tasked with a TAFE assignment that wanted me to document the installation of Windows on a brand new PC. Now about 3 months before, I had built my own PC. Then during a toy sale at a local Target, I saw a PS3 Bundle for $249. Thinking that it was an awesome deal, I got it to replace the old PS2.   We both enjoyed it greatly, but it somehow was never as pleasing as my PC despite the fact that I only had a HD 7750 4GB. Don't get that card. So I was kinda dissatisfied with it but my brother loved it as he only had a terrible, bread baking Compaq laptop. So, when I received this assignment my brother was a tiny bit jealous of my PC but still enjoying the PS3. Thinking fast, I gave him a deal. We sell the PS3 and use the money and some of his to build the PC I'll need for the assignment, and he gets it afterwards. He joyfully agrees but was still a little doubtful. After short negotiations with the parents, it was settled. I built him the same system as my own and he has never looked back. They were both Intel i3 3220 3.3GHz, HD 7750 4GB and 8GB RAM machines. Since I had a job, mine is now a GTX 650 TI OC 1GB and a Thermaltake Chaser A31 Thunder Blue while his is the same. That was around April and we have had hours of fun. From a two man army on _PERSON_, to derping around in _PERSON_, blowing up tracks in Split/Second and slaughtering _PERSON_. _PERSON_ is soon... Oh and the PS2 is still alive and kicking. We both still enjoy playing _PERSON_ 1 and Metal Arms: Glitch in the System.I also aced that assignment."

Apologies for saying, but that's ridiculous. In real life, a sniper rifle can shoot 1KM and kill. At 150M it's pretty hard to hit a moving target anyway so why nerf it? It's pretty much close range sniping now. I think the 150M should be raised to 250M-500M. That's not OP at all as it would take a ton of skill to hit that. Especially moving.

Me: *laughing like an idiot*EL: And frogs leave in wheelchairs because the French eat their legs. Me: *still laughing*EL: And what do you call a pig stealer? Me: I don't know, but there has to be a pun. Her: A Hamburglar. And as I start laughing again, she simply drives back into the store to her husband somewhere inside. I'm dumbstruck. Later she comes back and says:Have you heard any good jokes lately? Me: No, only the ones from you. Have a gorgeous day.

The 650 TI takes two but I have a wifi card as well. How can I combat this?Finally, if some of the above just isn't possible, what Micro ATX case can I get in the same price range as the Prodigy ($85 AU)?

I never got a floor job in a department, I was never in laybuy, nor back dock. I'm always serving fat, annoying, selfish ""mothers""  and their spawn that isn't much better. These ""anti fatigue"" mats are a joke too. Sometimes I'll get the door greeter job. Why? Because the door greeter is going on an hour lunch. Sometimes I'll get refunds because it's busy.

""I'll look into it""  or ""I'll talk to the other managers"". Yeah, right. I'm not lazy, it's not that I hate work. It's just how I work. I hate the registers. Sure, I look happy when I come in for my heartbreaking 5 hour shift with one 10 minute break that I have to remind them of, but it's only because I can't find another dang job thus I can't lose this one. I don't care if I earn $15 an hour, it's not darn worth it. Yes I need the money for college and travel and yes it's nice to have money. But it's not worth how I earn it.

Doesn't matter how long I play, it will do it. What I have noticed is that it does it the worst when loading large things. That could be a facility, group of enemies or vehicles. Either way, it stutters very badly for a few seconds often resulting in my death. One on one situations are almost impossible now as it's not just large things causing it. More testing would be needed I think. A curious side effect is that the current audio loops when it stutters. To put it visually, it's like when you win MS _PERSON_. The cards wipe down the screen. Hitching causes the audio to do the same and often as micro hitches are very common. I tried rolling back, but no help. I'm using a 770 2GB, i3 3220 3.3GHz and 8GB RAM.

I need to configure it as well because while I have a 770 2GB, I only have an i3 3220 3.3GHz.

2s40qb,25040,gamesyoumightnotknow,1421021658,Metal Arms: Glitch In The System for the PS2,"This game was one I rented from the video store about 5 years ago and loved it a lot. I did have trouble buying it though, got the only _PERSON_ version on eBay. Developed by Swinging Ape and Sierra. This game was about a robot civilisation that were trying to improve themselves. In the process, they created a new robot that went evil and created an army to enslave the original robot race. A rebellion started up to remove the opposing army and it's leader. You start as a unique robot that was found on a scout mission. You are taken back to the rebellion base and from there you progress through a pretty good amount of missions and locations. What I enjoyed about this game was the art style and gameplay. It looked great on the PS2 and didn't often dip below 30FPS unless you were fighting large groups. The art was unique, not using much inspiration from other games of its era. The enemies looked satisfying somehow, despite their voices saying otherwise. Gameplay was smooth. It's a third person shooter with an emphasis on slightly silly yet serious weaponry. Things like the Ripper which fires saw blades that can cut off enemy limbs. Or the S.P.E.W, Small Projectile Emitting Weapon, that is they equivalent of a machine gun. It also featured a weapon upgraded system but only by finding upgrade kits in the world. Some could be bought, just like energy (health) and ammo, but were often rare in the shop and expensive. The currency was Washers,and you collected these from destroyed enemies and a few rare gold ones in the world. Another unique for its time feature was the shop itself. There wasn't a stationary shop where you could travel to and buy, it was one that is run by two droids that show up in the oddest of places. As such you had to decided what to buy carefully as they weren't always in a level. The story was simple, yet enough to cover what the game was about. It didn't cover a few mysteries such as who you really are and where the Morbots went though. Morbots are the legendary robots that create power in the center of the planet but strangely vanished. I suspect these parts would have come in a sequel that was strongly hinted at the end of the game, but with Swinging Ape and Sierra being bought out, it sadly never happened. I really enjoyed this game for the reasons above. Solid and fun, while adding a hint of silliness. I post it here become I don't think it got the recognition it deserved.. If you own a PS2 and live in America, you'll have no problem finding a copy on eBay. If you live in Australia like me or England, it will be hard. Last I looked anyway. It can't be emulated either sadly, not sure why. That's my entry to this sub, seriously check out this game."

When I'm alone, I very often fail miserably. Of course, you learn though experience and practice, but I feel as if I've hit a limit of skill due to how my thought process is.

Fights containing more than 24 players per side are frequent and battles of 96 are possible. You will pick a faction to fight for before being dropped into a fight like you've never seen before. These factions and their basic traits are:**New Conglomerate**: The rebel faction of _PERSON_, these blue and yellow boys specialise in heavy hitting weapons capable of dropping targets with ease. It comes at a small cost of  extra recoil though. **Terrain Republic**: The imperialist army of _PERSON_, these red soldiers remain loyal to Earth, even hundreds of light years from home. Their weapons have larger clips and carry more in reserve to provide ammo to the faster firing weapons they carry. **_PERSON_**: These purple cultists have found the way of _PERSON_ and believe that all who refuse enlightenment should be exterminated. Carrying low recoil weapons with little to no bullet drop, these hippies are to be feared for their ability to put you down at range faster than others. The planet you're on is _PERSON_. You came here through a wormhole which suddenly destabilised leaving all stranded for the next 100 years. As time went on, relationships frayed and mutiny was imminent until the 3 factions were formed. Now each fights for control of _PERSON_ and to eliminate the opposing armies. However that was before rebirthing technology. Now it's an endless war full of subterfuge and brutality.

If his soul could help her produce a patronus, then it is not to far of a stretch to say he could produce one. Also, as far as I know, _PERSON_ is incapable of love but not happiness. A person's patronus is based on their happiest moment. Which leads me to believe _PERSON_'s patronus would either be a snake (day he found he was the heir of slytherin and it was his house's symbol) or perhaps a hog (this one is a bit ridiculous but there is potential seeing he found his home at HOGwarts)"

1y3748,18898,nosleep,1392585863,Nathan,"I have a special friend named _PERSON_. Not special like the boy with Down syndrome that was in my class last year. No, _PERSON_ is a different kind of special. _PERSON_ is special because I’m the only one who can see him. It’s ok if you don’t believe me, No one does. Not my mom. Not Mrs. _PERSON_. Not even the special doctor mom took me to sometimes. It’s okay though, it’s nice having a friend no one else can see.      I first saw _PERSON_ on the first day of grade two. I was hiding from the bullies that had tormented me since my first day of school. I had managed to elude them all summer. Now that I couldn’t hide in my house, I needed a new place to run to when they came for me. Today during morning recess I found I was just small enough to fit between the massive dumpster and the fence that boxed in the school. The only way I could make my hiding spot bearable was to stand with my back to the dumpster. It kept the smell of hot garbage from creeping into my nose.  This forced me to look through the fence onto the houses that backed on to the school. One house stood out. It looked broken down and sad, just like my mom did the night dad left. This was the house that _PERSON_ came out of.	 He leaned his head over to one side and asked me with a puzzled face “why are you standing against a dumpster’? “I’m playing _PERSON_ and Go seek.” I replied sharply. “We both know that’s not true” he stated matter-of-factly “I watch you every day. Those boys looking for you want to hurt you. You’ve been hurt a lot”. I could start to feel my ears start to burn with embarrassment. I think _PERSON_ noticed how I was feeling because he reached through the fence and put his hand on my shoulder and softly said “I won’t hurt you”. That’s what I love about _PERSON_, he always knew what I was thinking and feeling. 	So every day I went to the dumpsters to see _PERSON_. We quickly became best friends. He was exactly like me. We had the same favourite colour (crimson red), same favourite animal (tiger) and same favourite Pokémon (charmander). _PERSON_’s dad also left when he was seven, same as mine. I feel really bad for _PERSON_ because his dad is just like mine. He drank the same bubbly drink from the dark brown bottles. _PERSON_’s dad would start yelling and hitting his mom just like my dad did before he left. It was nice to have someone who knew what it felt like to have their dad leave. 	This went on until two days before thanksgiving. I really wanted to finish craft. It was a cut-out of my hand that I painted to look like a turkey. It had my favourite shade of red for the tail feathers. I was going to give it to my mom. So Mrs. _PERSON_ let me stay in class a few extra minutes. When I got outside the bullies were waiting for me. _PERSON_, the oldest and the meanest, saw me first. The look in his eyes made me freeze with fear. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t yell. The best I could do was a silent prayer that Mrs. _PERSON_ would come outside before I got beat up to bad. Within seconds they surround me, looking like a pack of wolves about to make their final move on a wounded dear. “Thought you could hide?” jeered _PERSON_. “We’ve been waiting a long time for this” said one of the boys behind me. Next thing I knew one of the stronger boys pinned my arms behind my back. After that, all the bullies went feral. Fists, feet, knees and elbows slammed into my body from all direction.       I woke up in the nurse’s office. I sat up and rubbed my eyes. I looked around the empty room half expecting the bullies to pour in and resume their attack. I got up and pressed my ear against the door that connected to the office. I could hear mom shrieking like a banshee at the principal, Mr. _PERSON_. I would write down what she said but I’m not allowed to use some of the words she used until I’m older. The gist of my mom and Mr. _PERSON_’s one sided conversation was that Mrs. _PERSON_ had found me outside on the pavement after I didn’t come in from recess. This wasn’t the part that made my mom scream. She was mad that because no one saw what happened so they couldn’t punish anyone. I jumped when I heard the voice behind me. I turned quickly and end up face to face with _PERSON_. “Would you like me to take care of the bullies?” he repeated. I just stood there in shock. Partly because I was still recovering from being startled. Mostly because no one had ever offered to take care of anything for me. I slowly started nod. A wicked grin slithered up _PERSON_’s cheeks. “Go to our spot at lunch tomorrow and when you get back it will all be taken care of”. I couldn’t sleep that night. I was worried that something bad was going to happen to _PERSON_. I don’t remember lunch the next day. My memory starts with me seeing _PERSON_ walk into our classroom when the bell rang for recess. It ends with me in Mr. _PERSON_’s office, sitting in the chair across from his, with bruised knuckles and my favourite colour all over my shirt. Mr. _PERSON_ and Mrs. _PERSON_ both kept asking me what happened. It took them an hour before they believed I didn’t know what happened. With hesitation they slowly told me what happened. When we were in the coat room getting ready to go outside, I started beating _PERSON_ with my metal lunch box. I must have done something really bad to him because I can hear the ambulance outside. Next I went after the other boys and didn’t stop until their faces were covered in my favourite colour. I don’t think any of it is true because _PERSON_ told he did all of it. When my mom came into the office she looked at me with the same eyes she reserved for my dad when he started drinking bubbly drink. Mr. _PERSON_ and she talked for a while. He said that he knows a special doctor that I could go to. Holding back tears, my mom told me to get up and drove me to the special doctor.I told the special doctor about _PERSON_. About how he defended me. About how he did those mean things to the bullies, not me. My mom told him about my dad and his problems with the bubbly drink. The doctor just sat there, writing notes down and looking more and more concerned. Finally he stopped asking questions. I don’t really remember what the exact word was but apparently I have something wrong with my head that makes me see things. It makes me see _PERSON_. They gave me some little yellow pills that I have to take every day. They also brought me to a special place. I don’t see _PERSON_ much anymore. The little old ladies that take care of me at the special place make sure I take my pills. When I first got to the special place I cried and screamed a lot. Whenever I did I got a timeout. Not the kind of timeout where you stand in the corner for five minutes. The kind of time out where they strap you to the bed and give you a needle. Mom comes and visits sometimes. She always comes with the same eyes she had when my dad left. She doesn’t have to worry for much longer. I kept my pills under my tongue today. _PERSON_ dropped by to ask if I wanted him to take care of the nurses."

188jqk,46549,SuicideWatch,1360479069,20 M losing hope that this will ever get better.,"To preface:  I've been clinically depressed for years.  Been on countless medications (sometimes the doctor took me off sometimes I just stopped taking them).  _PERSON_ once (last year about this time) for five days because I was ruled a danger to myself before being released to go live with my family.  Stay with them for a couple months before deciding to drop out of the college I couldn't afford and start working an hour from my family in the city I grew up in, living with four friends.So here's my mindset:  To sum it up in a word I would say ""dispair"".  Every morning I wake up and wonder why I hadn't ended it the night before to save myself the agony of facing another day.  I mean I'm doing ok in the appearances department (ie. job, friends, on good terms with most my family, a place with buddies, and am active in a local theater company) but noone seems to understand that while I can see these positives  I can go a minute without thinking of a different way I could kill myself.  Nothing makes me happy anymore I might feel a spark of cheerfulness every now and again but I cant help but see the world and life as pointless.  I hate it when people ask well do you know how you'd kill yourself.  At any moment in time I have infinite was I could do it and I'm creative enough to think/daydream about a lot of them.  Two days ago I found myself researching different methods effectiveness, pian levels, and speed.  It scares the fucking shit out of me that I can't control these emotions or thoughts and the only reason I've been holding on is because I don't want to fuck up my younger siblings or allow my roommates to find my body.  I realize that second option could be easily remedied but I feel that if I reach that point it will be the most spiritual and intense moment of my life and I would want to be somewhere I felt safe and comfortable.  I've tried talking with my roommates about these topics but don't get much of a response.  I know they don't know the extent of my depression but they do recognize that I'm not getting out of bed until after 3pm on an almost daily basis.  When we first moved in together I explained as best I could my depression and warning signs from the past that I should not be left to my own devices (and have discussed since then).  The person who is closest to understanding where I am is my mother and after my hospitalization last year she in a way almost seems scared of me and I feel like the thought that rolls through my head constantly has invaded hers and shes wondering if maybe her son cant be fixed.  I don't want to hurt the people that have done their best to help my through the years but it only ever gets worse.  I'm tired of these thoughts and daydreams being in my head.  I need them to come within my at least somewhat control or I'm going to crash and burn.Thanks for reading my textual vomit and complete pity party."

Post operation I am given some high grade ibuprofen, Tylenol, and some sort of antibiotic that apparently has pain killer properties.  Once I had been driven home I took my medicines and waited for them to kick in.  After a short while I noticed their effect:  They were making me incredibly sleepy and lethargic and yet did not manage to kill the pain in my jaw.  I took a nap and woke up to an alarm telling it was time to take more pills.  Once again I began to feel those same effects.  I complained to my bestfrient about it and how I thought trees would probably help more than what I was taking but how I couldn't because of the suction it creates.  I then went to the restroom but upon returning he had the broadest grin on his face and began to explain that it we passed it quick enough he would be able to pull the stem when it was full and pass it to me so I could still get the smoke but this hardly any suction.  He then proceded to sit down and smoke in such an monor with me until I could hardly feel the pain and was feeling alert.  Thanks to my bestfrient I will able to enjoy my day.TLDR: Post wisdom teeth removal bestfrient discovers a way to be able to smoke with me by filling the bong and letting me clear it and helped with my pain and sleepyness from medication."

I've never really told this story to anyone, and my story got buried. I was hoping at least one person could hear me out and what I had experienced.**I had to spend 3 days in a hospital. Across from me was a very old woman. I had to be ""on watch"" so I always had a doctor/watcher with me in the room, 24/7. One night he fell asleep, and I woke up to the old woman moaning and crying from behind her curtains. I heard the doctor shush her, and go back to sleeping in his chair.I pressed my call button so that someone would come to assist her. Then she started begging ""please.. oh god please help me..... help me..... please"" (It was like, 3AM) I got up from my bed, pulled back her curtains and pressed the emergency call by her bed. She was on her side crying. She grabbed my hand and begged me to help her... I told her someone was coming to help...After someone finally arrived, the shoved me away from her bed and told me to go away... we were in the same room only seperated from a curtain, so I heard everything. I went back to my bed, the doctor who fell asleep FINALLY got up to help. After some struggling and running around, it was evident that she wasn't doing well. A few things disturbed me about this. Like hearing the doctor say ""Should we suction her?"" and the doctor who fell asleep previously saying ""Nahhhh...""I fell asleep afterwards again. I woke up early in the morning to hear her family crying by her bedside. Again, I went back to sleep. When I awoke it was time for me to be discharged from the hospital, I pulled her curtains open, and saw the most disturbing thing I've ever witnessed. Her body, on the bed, wrapped in a white body bag. I slept beside her dead body all night.**tr;dr Slept beside a dead body.**"

So that night he was eating a meal and we waited till he’d finished and me my _PERSON_ and my brother went down to see him and my _PERSON_ spoke cause I just stood there shaking and staring at him. And my _PERSON_ asked for an autograph, but he was so nice and he was talking to my _PERSON_, they were actually having some conversation. He signed my brothers first and my brother was wearing a Man United t-shirt with _PERSON_ on and _PERSON_ went “oooo giggsy!”  Then he did mine and he was like what’s you name and I was like _PERSON_ and he looked up at me with his beautiful eyes and his long long eyelashes and I just melted. His accent is the most amazing accent I have ever heard and his voice is actually beautiful. He said to us “I’m very flattered that you noticed me.” The autograph said “Dear _PERSON_, Lovely to meet you in Tangiers. Lots of Love _PERSON_ (his signature) x” and he also did one for my friend. Then he promised us a photo on another day. Because he’s filing a movie along side _PERSON_, called Only Lovers Left Alive and he’s playing a vampire called _PERSON_. So he came back in his costume and we walked out of our room and we had no idea it was him. And he just went “HEY GUYS! TOLD YOU I’D LOOK WEIRD!” cause he told us earlier that he had to wear a wig. _PERSON_’s face was all painted white and he had some black long wig on and black tight trousers and a shirt and boots and he looked like some rocker. I have never been so scared in my life. And I just went “Oh god.” I wrote him a letter and I gave it to him because I knew I’d never be able to say what I wanted to say to him to his face. “And he told us our letters were very sweet.” Then one day he came knocking on our room and said that he could the photo quick now. And I was just stood there nodding really fast. So we went into the halls and took the photo. He put his arm around me and one around my brother. So I was like this will probably be the only chance I get to do this so I put my arm around his waist and the photo was taken. Then every time he saw us he’d say hi and ask us how we were and stuff. We also met _PERSON_ and I was just stood there like w-w-white witch. But _PERSON_ was so so so so so so so so so nice and so so so so so so so so so perfect.""original post: _PERSON_"

He has shit armor because I wasn't prepared, and he ended up dying.So I reloaded right as I enter the same room (I have all auto-saves on; on sleep, wait, etc) and he's not there. Good. Must have been a weird coincidence? Dr._PERSON_ runs up, tells me about the scientist again, I give her stimpacks... BAM! Charon spawns in the back! WTF! This time I didn't say anything to him... just left him there... maybe the problem would correct itself. Got out of the tunnels ""Charon has returned to the Ninth Circle""All of my WAT."

They saved me. I'm in a serious relationship and got engaged about a year ago. My sex drive has been dying since before we met. I know it's the medication, but I wanted to know if anyone else experienced/is experiencing this and how they cope? I do not get horny. Ever. If I do, it's once every month or two. And it passes quickly. I want to know... medications, vitamins, ANYTHING that can help my brain release chemicals to help arousal... I'm really desperate here. Additional info: I've mostly been on Effexor, but after a few convos with my SO I added Wellbutrin into the mix. Which is known to help with increasing the sex drive when experiincing decreased sex drive while taking other medications. It helps with my depression while the Effexor helps with the anxiety. It also helps with the fatigue in the Effexor. I feel happier in general, and this cocktail of medications is perfect, IMO.

2c2bsn,49110,SuicideWatch,1406657877,copypaste from a blog i have. just want my words heard.,"there just isn’t anything i want in life. having someone love me unconditionally isn’t worth unfeeling, nonchalant melancholy of everyday. i do know i feel bad for it. i feel bad i don’t and can’t show love back to anyone. i physically cringe when my mother ever tried to touch me. just simple expressions of love. i sit stone faced as my fiance uses all his strength to fight back tears while telling me he wishes i loved him. i mean. i do love him. but i physically and emotionally am so detached from everyone and everything that i just don’t show it in any way. if you were presented two options as neo was in the matix - two pills - take one, and everything just continues and you can experience all life has to offer - or take the other, and everything simply ends as it hits your stomach. which would you choose?i’ve been reading a bit about assisted euthanasia. no, i don’t want to shoot myself in the face, jump off a building, OD on sleeping meds (cuz that worked so well last time, 3days in the hospital and seizures are super fun). I want something professional, medically assisted, and painless. under supervision, around people who understand ones life should be ones choice. i’ve been here since I was 13, i’d say. when my brother died. that was the first time i burst into tears for a reason that wasn’t “a boy doesnt like me” or “school sux”. i learned what pain could be. flash forward to age 25, hospitals, suicide attempt, medications, promiscuity, severe _PERSON_, it’s just not something i want to be a part of. i have no talent or hobby, nothing makes me light up with life. except cats, and the occasional obsession (show, music, etc). that’s not enough to keep someone alive. i’ve been running on these fumes for a long time. I’m not even sad anymore. my fiance leaves for work and i sometimes just sit on a chair in our hallway. and I just stare. listening to ambient noises throughout the house. from outside. the front door is usually always open. I just blankly stare and wonder where to go. how do i stop this? who can help me? I told my fiance the other day I want a therapist. after some thinking, i don’t know anymore. I don’t want someone telling me it can get better. I don’t need someone to tell me what’s wrong with me. i’m borderline with massive depressive disorder, general anxiety due to (mostly because of) _PERSON_NOS recovered from anorexic and mild bulimic tendancies. i don’t have friends, i have acquaintances. and thats fine. i’m no longer going to name names because that’s just putting people in a position they shouldn’t have to be in. like they have some obligation to try and be there for me??? lol no, bby no, seriously. this is a long time coming, and you’re really just helping make my last days a little less stressful. so I thank you all for that. you know who you are. if you think I might be talking about you, I likely am.i am just so peacefully done."

It's always been this way. I will literally toss and turn for an hour non-stop.* I take medications for anxiety &amp; depression so I'm sure that probably has some effect on my brain.

For example, I was browsing reddit and saw a post about a bunch of siblings (younger ones) who all liked to sleep in one big bed together. I know it's normal and cute and bonding for most people, but I thought about it with my siblings (or any family) and it disgusted me. Like, I don't know, I don't want to touch these people? I don't understand why I feel this way...My mom tries to hug me, or just touch me and I flinch away. I'm extremely hesitant to give hugs when they are due (saying hello, or goodbye, etc)Family grosses me out and I don't understand why, but I wonder if anyone else experiences the same.

There may be canonical errors in the writing, but please don't critique that.

Thank you.*----------------I take my first steps onto the Space Colony, wreckage and ruin lying around.	It’s an abysmal scene I’m presented with. The panels are torn from their walls, scarred by claws sunken deep into the metallic interior. There’s a whistling intermixing with the wails and shrieks of sirens down below.	Previously the only struggle there had been aboard the colony was my resulting scratches from battles past, clashing with the perfection surrounding myself.  In contrast to that day, my armor now pales in comparison to the numerous accolades and awards left in ruin aboard here, making me feel as though there’s no peace left anywhere in the world, the dark destruction seeping into my psyche.	“Shake it off.” I tell myself. It’s shallow of me to be pessimistic and helpless in a situation such as this. If I’ve learned anything from past encounters with pirates, it’s surely that a sniveling girl will do no damage to them, even if she’s dressed stylishly in highly expensive and functional power armor._PERSON_ intermingle with the halls around, activating the door lock mechanism only to be greeted by darkness. It should make sense that the halls would lack power, I note, recalling my passing of the ruined wires in my descent into the colony. Lacking any sort of light, I power past the rubble.	I disregard the bodies left lying in the intruders wake. They too share the reptilian scars along their back, or chests. Some lack their heads, others their limbs. But not one of the technicians I had come into contact with earlier, so intelligent and innocent, had any ounce of a soul left inside of themselves. All that was left of each one I saw was the same lifeless corpse, its hollow piercing gaze penetrating my thick exterior right into my core._PERSON_ once again to hit the switch, the door slides open, allowing me to see inside of the main control room. Only mere days before had I witnessed this same station, bustling with energy, as everyone was so proud of my accomplishment. After my collection of the small innocent baby larva (in all honesty it had immediately clung to me after hatching) I deposited it here at the space station to have a multitude of tests performed upon it. Interestingly enough immediately after being  separated from me, the youngling whimpered and whined, matching the sirens left in the hollow skeleton of the room now.	The scientists had discovered the immeasurable amount of power the child could produce, as though it were some form of a biotic battery. They had solved the everlasting problem of a source of renewable energy, allowing major technological advancements to proceed in the acquisition of the child._PERSON_, left in its wake, is an empty vessel, with the holding container of the metroid cracked and destroyed, glass shards scattered across the trembling floor, reflecting the scent of blood and the shadows of those long gone for me to intake.The metroid is no longer here, but the container still feels warm. The metal case has been opened as though by a child’s rash excitement at opening it’s new present, unable to wait for a more professional way of acquiring the treasures inside. There’s more blood, but this time with purple scales, and the blood a darker tinge than before. It’s at this moment, when I rush throughout the corridors and down the long shaft I realize the only rash, reckless and ruthless being that could have performed such an action as this:Ridley.The imbecilic and hot-headed moron must’ve decided that he wanted the metroid for some other reason, and ultimately stole it all for himself. Doesn’t he realize how dangerous the living saprophyte could be? I can only imagine the child to cling to his face similarly as it had done to my own, but of course him lacking the protective helmet to defend himself from his life being drained slowly - and painfully I would wish - away.Finally I arrive at the conclusion of my exploration through the colony. It is here I find the child, reflecting the destruction lying around it in it’s glossy effervescent cover, protecting the energy source left inside of it.But ... there’s something else ... something sinister .... something-White.His teeth appear first, followed by large golden slits left for eyes. Bearing numerous scars and a multitude of scrapes akin to the station. Bloody and battered claws marry his surroundings to himself, almost as though he feels home among his chaos. King of his corruption.Producing an earth shattering screech that sends the bravest soldiers home in moments. On a sudden updraft his wings take flight, only to descend viscously in attempt to attack the intruder desecrating his palace. In a violet streak of violence his only goal is my demise. I dodge the claws streaking past me and producing repeated blasts of energy in an attempt to allow him to relinquish the protective grasp on the child. We exchange blows upon each other, but mine are all in vain. As he calmly reflects each attack upon himself, I cripple and double over, fearing almost that it’s too late to become victorious in this confrontation, never giving up on the escapade however, even if I am sure it is hopeless. 	Suddenly each alarm produces a drastic shift in pitch, halting the war between knight and dragon, signalling our cue to exit the stage.Ridley takes notice, providing once again his bone white reptilian grin, smashing the last of the generators in the building, and allowing the oxygen to slowly decrease, and certain doom to be imminent.Escaping through the corrugated thick metallic roof, the last trace of him I can see is a minute blood splatter left upon the ground, and the piercing wails of the infant resonating into the endless void.Following his move, I take heed instantaneously. The infantile tremors evolve into catastrophic quakes, tilting the colony from left to right, front to back. As I sprint past the corpses and wreckage surrounding my haste ridden escape, I take no notice of the empty vessels this time. Their memories forgotten, their innocence lost to the chaos of the situation, left to burn inside the caustic crucible they all have created.Finally, springing off of platforms, and clinging to the last energy I have, I arrive at the elevator, and promptly to my ship.With no idea where he is going but pressing deep into the accelerator, I speed away from the explosion resulting from Ridley’s wreaked havoc upon it.No concept of time or space, my only mission is the acquisition of what’s mine, I allow my mind to slowly accept,  as I throttle through comets and constellations, arriving at my next adventure.	It is no longer merely for a reward my recapture of the infantile parasite, nor for any of the hollow bones scattered now throughout the galaxy._PERSON_ has taken my work, and shown the true extent he will go to obtain it, and ultimately I would assume to render it all in vanity.	It is only fair that his reward be the same of the cosmic corpses he’s left in his path to do so."

1ug92q,11994,depression,1388912678,A standard day,"It's a long post so bear with me on this, sorry.Have you ever been at the top of the world? The future looks so high you're almost soaring past all skyscrapers and obstacles, nothing able to stand in your way.See that was me, long ago I suppose, younger. I was in sports, top of the class, loads of friends. I was given the holy grail of labels, every teacher having the words ""gifted"" and ""intelligent"" on their lips. I was known everywhere I went, for many things, almost as a sort of super star.But then I moved away from all that, and crashed into the bottom. It's funny, I never felt the bottom before ninth grade, but I knew I was there when I lived underneath someone blaring music as I was trying to read. New school, new faces, still able to stay above water but feeling the waves lap gently across my toes. I no longer had that confidence, where I could do anything I believed. Now I was resigned into reality, not caring or not trying to be that superstar anymore.That resignation spiraled eternally throughout my life as my brain got wiser, classes got harder, and I felt more weak than ever. The god at the top of his palace now lay in rubble, bawling his eyes out over the ghosts and ashes around him. My grades went from A's to B's and then to C's. More and more homework had to come home, life turned from vibrant colours cascading around me to a wash of grey in which nothing was interesting. But the worst of it all was that I felt I no longer mattered. I was a cut out in a world of paper mâché. Each time I wanted to speak, I only heard a million corrections in response. If everyone is an individual than why is it either I share a common opinion with everyone else or my opinion is wrong and I'm forced to submit?Even now my life feels fruitless. I have all the qualifications to be making an approximately 15-20 dollar and hour salary, yet I run out the clock pricing and stocking at minimum wage.Each day I look in the mirror and that reflection is cracked, the smiles gone as they are no longer real but a facetious persona worn each day. I have no one to love, and no one to love me. I'm spinning my wheels in neck high water as I try to tread eternally, but it isn't working.I'm getting angrier at people, as I try to still maintain that god-like composure. Even now as I'm writing this I'm playing out faults in my wording, for fear criticism I just cannot accept will come again.I have no hope. It's my senior year. I'm supposed to be a leader, being class president, but I'm not the dick but a swallower instead. I have not made any thought to what my future will be, while everyone else around me is declaring checkmate against Father Time while I'm making the first move.I'm hopeless, in ruin, a shadow of my former self.I don't expect anyone to read this far, so why I'm typing this is beyond me, but I'm so tired right now that I just can't take the whirlwind of chaos inside my fucked up mind. Each day thoughts gets larger and larger, and sometimes it's even peaked, but when it spills over even then I'm clawing at the door praying for a second chance I'll never take advantage of.I'm a fuck up.Plain and simple.Sorry for the length.Have a nice evening"

1x86po,11994,SuicideWatch,1391731750,I stood in front of a bus today,"And the bus driver stoppedHe made a very confused face as I stood there, the rest of the awaiting passengers jeering and guffawing at me, their only concern being to get to where they needed to go.I got on the bus but the driver stopped me, asking ""Why'd you do that? What do you want to do? Get run over?""I didn't know how to answer, so I just looked at him. Because even though it seemed like mindless anger or just a minor thing, truth is part of me did.But I just turned and apologized to the man, taking a seat next to a window and turning away in the silent bus, soon growing loud once again.I don't know why I'm here, cause I'm guessing it'll just be people guffawing or upset about where they need to go.Maybe it's self absorbed to stand in front of a bus. I don't know. Maybe I'm so egotistic that I need people to care about *me* all the time, or whateverIn any case I got where I needed to goAnd I told him ""I'm sorry for any inconvenience"" as I left.And that's what happened.Sorry."

2moxkt,11994,SF4,1416338589,Concern and comments,"Whenever I see people playing this game I feel as though I want to play. It seems like a fun time, and with the legacy SF has obtained, it's simple to imagine many people wanting to pick the game up.Unfortunately, nothing helps the player in any sense in allowing them to improve.Let me clarify:1. The game has no sense of a tutorial mode. None. If we are to count trials as something of a tutorial, this is not truly helpful as these combos and specials do little to nothing to aid the player. They will subsequently be destroyed (emotionally and physically) by the game, even though they are using the tools given to them *by the game*.2. Playing against computers teaches the player that the easiest alternate is the best. What I mean by this is the constant (do not try to deny, it is there in the ai) hadouken spam, or any other repeated move. It cheapens the experience when (to succeed) the player must either decrease difficulty in order to win legitimately, or resort to the same tactics as the CPU , only in order to clutch that win. It's by no means a healthy attitude for one to pick up, and destructive to both their actions in this game (from what I've seen no pro players do this ... At least I hope not...) and in the real world as well.3. Online is essentially the same thing. When you enter the lobby, while variation is present, these same people you are facing resort to either a continuous spam of moves and retreat, or obsessive turtling, to the point where you will begin winning or losing matches based upon time, not player skill.As well, speaking of skill, the matchmaking system is abhorrently atrocious. When fresh, new players are paired with veterans with an A rank for their character, you know something is wrong. They will subsequently be destroyed in the game, and have no way of improving upon where they are now. Truly it defeats the purpose of the ranking system whatsoever. (Honestly, not trying to offend anyone here, this sort of online play reminded me a lot of Call of Duty, where the people who are already superb at this game become gods in comparison to others.)4. It's astounding that people who play this game so well are so reluctant to aid people. This subreddit occasionally provides assistance to those wanting help with mastering a character, but here is the only exception. Time and time again when someone asks something as simple as ""How do I block"" they will receive a simple response of ""Get Gud Scrub."" I understand this is an issue with online play in general, but one must keep in mind this is not a simple game by any means. The complexity of this game is more than skin deep, and a response such as this hinders greatly, turning fans away from what could be an amazing experience.In closing, I can only address new players reading this: keep at it. I'm sorry (and I'm sure others are as well) this game is so unforgiving, and it's players are just as cruel. But when you do finally obtain that win, it will be worth it for all of the damage you received. Practice is key. As said by many, practice with friends, and have a good time. The online is a joke, so you might as well laugh at it, and when you're with friends, you can't have any issues. Just laugh and have a good time. After all, PP doesn't matter.I know this will get down voted, but all I'm hoping is it prompts a discussion. Am I saying that this complexity should be removed? No. Of course not. That's half the fun of the game. My main concern is that there should be an easier transition for new players. Maybe rank matching could be improved, so A level veterans don't encounter new players, as no one improved by the end of it. Maybe there could be lobbies made specifically for training. I don't know, I'm not Capcom. All I know is something needs to be fixed, or else this game will soon have its reputation stripped, and it's community will thrive in infamy.Downvote away. Just speaking my mind. Sorry if it offended anyone.EDIT: Hey everyone, thank you for your comments and concerns as well!I've realized after the past little bit that nothing is worth getting as angry I was over, including Street Fighter (believe it or not).While I still feel there are valid complaints in my argument/rant above, the malice and spite easily detectable in them is not true.I've realized that maybe I'm not the best at this, and that's ok. I can still beat my friends, and I may still play it occasionally online, but for now I'm content just practicing with my friends for fun (lest I turn into a former pro fighting game player).Thank you all for your kind words. This community is *not* unforgiving, and is actually helpful (minus a few exceptions of course). And to those coming here to find some sort of validity in how this game is ""bullshit"", it's really not. Some games are for some people, some aren't. I certainly am not a SF guy, and I'll settle for that gladly.Thank you everyone. The day I posted this was the day I learned a lot, but for you it was just a Tuesday."
2v2hf3,11994,depression,1423288814,I'm petrified of dying alone,"I used to think the main goal out o having a relationship with someone would be simply to have sex. That was the point.But I'm now starting to realize that there's more to it than that. It's the feeling of someone being beside you, sharing in your experience. Someone who you work with constantly to achieve a common goal. I desire the days where it's raining and you share a warm blanket, watching movies or reading a book. The nights spent beside someone, where you don't need to say a single word because they already know what you're feeling and care about how you're feeling as well. Someone to hold hands with.But I find I can't achieve this. I'll smile at people coyly over the counter at work, or share a laugh and find comfort with female friends briefly, but it never lasts.The times I do have some form of a relationship are disastrous to say the least. My longest ""official"" relationship, is two weeks. I blew it because I didn't want to stay. Aside from her, I've had someone who deeply cared about me in the exact same way I want now, and I took advantage of her. Not sex. I didn't rape her or anything. It was emotionally, where she'd give me the world, and is merely distance myself. The times we'd meet, were always in secret, because I was afraid of commitment. She would give me the world, and I'll Id want was sex, or a kiss. Nothing committing.The above makes the feelings I feel worse as I realize the chance I had, and how I absolutely blew it out of the water. She now hates me. She's stated that she'll still talk to me, but never in that loving way again. She'll never look at me with those beautiful eyes, showing she did care. Through each sentence she says, or the words I receive via text, I sense the underlying hatred and abandonment, wishing I was dead.And that's why I'm here ... Again. I thought I was happy. And sometime I am (most of the time really to be honest. There are far more people worthy of your time than I so thanks for stopping by!) but when I look at my life on a solo drive home, or a day spent alone watching YouTube videos and playing video games, I can't help but think  a colossal failure of a person, and shouldn't be here.I think of my abuse to the person mentioned above, my reluctance to commit to any relationship, and how now, I've done a 180 turn, and it all feels like I'm using people again!I look at people who have relationships, sharing each other, and I think ""why can't I have that?"" And then I realize I did. And I never will again.Idk. I'm a fucking moron I guess.I'm not going to do anything. Tomorrow is another day, and I'm sure I'll bounce back. But all I can say is it's certainly no fun being the one guy on Valentine's Day who says ""Oh I'm just gonna play _PERSON_ and eat chocolate all day. You have fun with your dates."""

115387,41946,asktransgender,1349710400,DAE not get upset when people ask questions out of ignorance?,"I know many people here take the attitude that it isnt our job to educate people about trans* issues and that asking extremely personal questions about genitalia/surgery/whatever should be met with resistance or downright hostility. I'm curious if this is the majority opinion of trans* people or if many people take the opportunity to educate people.I'm prompted to ask this question because just a few minutes ago I was at a local food store buying some things to make for lunch and was asked by a cashier ""Are you going through a.... uh... change?... um... thing?"" I frequent this place almost every day, and have seen this same cashier many, many times since before I even started to transition. The store also happened to be quite empty at this point, with just me and the cashier within earshot and a manager at the far end of the counter. I laughed a little to put her at ease and answered that yes I was. She proceeded to ask a few personal questions that I know a great many people on here would have felt were too personal. I took the chance to educate her on some basics.The thing is, I have a hard time getting mad at people for simply being curious. She wasnt trying to be mean, or malicious and was very, very embarrassed to be asking such questions. I try to look at it from their perspective. They get to know their customers on some level, and they have watched my appearance change quite drastically over the past few months. It is only natural to be curious as to what is going on with people you see every day, and to many people, they really do have no idea how such things work. Indeed, they may not even realize what IS going on before asking questions.Does anyone else smile and educate when asked such questions rather than reacting sharply or I am alone?"
11rdtf,41946,asktransgender,1350671827,How likely am I to lose my job?,"A bit of background: I am a 26 year old MTF person who works for a medium size (50-100 employees) enterprise computer consulting firm based in grand rapids michigan. I'm pretty good at my job and have been getting pretty consistent and decent sized raises when performance review time rolls around. I am a consultant so I go to all of our customer sites to perform storage array setups for HP, EMC and Dell and usually also do a VMware vSphere install. I hold a number of certifications some of which are important for our company to maintain our partner status with our vendors, as in, I go away and our company loses that status. I spent 4 years in college but didnt get a degree, preferring to spend time actually learning rather than attempting to chase a piece of paper. My father also works for the same company doing the same job. The two of us are the only ones who can install HP storage in the whole company actually.The thing is, I'm terrified about losing my job by coming out at work. I still dress in male clothing at work but it is rapidly starting to be awkward. My hair is getting longer, my face softer and my body smaller (in addition to losing muscle mass, I've also been losing fat due to diet/exersise change). All of these things excite me and I'm way happy but I want to know if I should start looking around for something new now or if most people think I will be ok.West michigan is kind of odd socially. The people I work with are all relatively young and seem to live fairly progressive lives but every once and a while I have a sharp reminder that most of them self-identify as conservative. I think there is one guy there who is gay, but he isnt out and commonly refers to a ""girlfriend"" that he has at work.I'm sure I'm just being a neurotic mess and I shouldnt worry about such things but if I'm going to lose the best job I've had in a while, I'd really like to have SOME idea ahead of time so I can mentally prepare. None of you know me or the environment I work in, so its hard for you to judge, but any feedback would be nice. Tell me about your coming out at work stories or similar situations."

Just need to rant.,"I'm posting this with my main instead of a throwaway because I'm trying to be a lot more honest with how I feel. You all can basically see who I am and I don't care. If no one posts here, that's fine, although I wouldnt mind a chat with someone, anyone about anything. I didn't sleep at all last night. I'm out of town this week staying with friends. We went out to a bar, and I'm really freaking lonely. I got all dressed up and frankly I really wanted someone, anyone to go home with. I went home from the bar, early, with the friends I came with. I don't know what I expected. I cried on the way home. I don't even really know why. My friends were worried, but I brushed them off. Told them it was nothing and not to worry about me. I know I'll be fine. I know I'm probably just having a crappy day (errrr... 24 hour period, whatever). I then proceeded to stay up all evening. I stared at the TV while a show was playing and drank an entire pot of coffee myself. The 15 minutes where I nodded off, sitting on the couch I had a nightmare. I dreamed that my teeth had become super brittle and that they were starting to shatter and fall out of my mouth. It was vivid, painful and scary. I think this comes from the fact that I have a really hard time taking care of myself. I went 8 years without brushing my teeth. It just wasn't important to me. I sort of assumed that I would die before it mattered. I don't know why I thought this, but I have been consistently surprised to be alive. When I was 18 I thought for sure I wouldnt make it to 20. When  was 20 I thought for sure I wouldnt make it to 22. So on and so on... I grind my teeth in my sleep, I gnaw at my fingers and fingernails until they are bloody, misshapen and gross pretty much any time I get anxious. I go days without showering and then when I do I turn the shower way too hot. I think I love the feel of my skin burning. I know these are all horrible, self-destructive, behaviors and I really wish I knew how to stop myself. I try to stop it, but it seems like I just can't make any progress. I feel like I have no control over myself, my actions or my habits. I feel like something else is ruling my life and I just feel completely out of control. I know the way I want my life to be but I just cant ever seem to get all the way there. I never have the energy or motivation or discipline to make myself do the things I should and I have no idea how to get it. I feel like even the most out of control and impulsive people in the world have more mastery of themselves than I do and the only reason that I'm not dead as a result is because I'm an inherently boring person. I have all the self-control of a crazy, party-going, substance abusing gypsy without any of the interesting desires. When left to myself I'll sit alone, at home, consume massive quantites of cafiene, alternate between starving myself because I feel guilty about my weight and just saying ""fuck it, I'll get fat and don't care."" I don't even fucking know why I'm posting in this subreddit. I have no depression diagnosis and probably don't even belong here. I dont know what I expect from you folks.

I guess this is just a stream of consciousness vent session, so I'm sorry in advance for this whole thing. In addition, I guess I should also warn people that there may be some depression, suicide, or self-harm triggers in this post. Sorry if this upsets anyone. I was travelling today and had to take a flight. As anyone who has taken a flight in the US in the past decade knows, its a hassle, but if you keep your head down, do what you are told and have lots of patience its fine. Well today was not fine. I've been on hormones for almost two years and feel like they haven't really done _PERSON_ shit. I spent the entire day in the airport getting ""sir""ed by every TSA agent, flight attendant and clerk I interacted with. I can't really get mad at them I guess, they are only saying what they see. Before I started transition, I tried to kill myself. I downed a bottle of sleeping pills with a bunch of tequila. Had a friend not come home from work early, found me, made me puke, then kept me awake for the next 8 hours I probably would be dead. It was not my first suicide attempt. Right before my first therapist appointment I made a deal with myself because of how unsure I was about all of this: I would give myself two years. I wouldn't attempt suicide for two years, I would spend two years on hormones, getting happy and building my life the way I wanted it. I would spend two years doing whatever the fuck I wanted. After two years, if I was still miserable, I would do it in a way no one could stop me: shoot myself in the forehead or jump off of a tall building.Those two years will be up in April, three months from now. By any objective standard my life has improved vastly since then. I found a great job doing what I like. That job affords me the opportunity to travel (which is the reason I flew today) and see much more of the country than many of my friends do. I get to solve interesting and complex problems for people who genuinely appreciate my work. I'm performing well at work and was recently told that I receive more unsolicited compliments from customers than any other consultant at our company. This job has afforded me financial opportunities that few people my age pull off. I own my own home, two cars, have had laser to remove facial hair and I never had to worry about where the money was going to come from for my doctor visits, hormones or anything else. I have a great group of very supportive friends and family, all of whom stuck by me. Very few of them slip up with my name or pronouns anymore and all of them tell me I look great. I've lost a bunch of weight since I started hormones. When I started I weighed 210lbs. Now I'm 155lbs, which is a lot more normal for someone who is 5'9"". The hormones alleviated a lot of depression and stress I was feeling, which meant that I didn't try to eat and drink myself into a stupor anymore and the weight just came off.Despite the gains, I can't help but focus on the losses particularly after a day like today. I look like shit, the depression seems to be back in full force and now to top it all off I'm kind of fixated on my weight and how much food I eat. I've had 600 calories today, and had 900 yesterday. I try to limit myself to 800 calories a day but sometimes I get so hungry that I just cant help myself. I'll binge on a whole pizza or burger and fries or something like that. A few times after a binge I've purged to try and get rid of it, but when I throw up all of the muscles in my throat and face tense so hard that I will burst blood vessels all over my face and neck. It makes me look like I suddenly sprouted a bunch of weird freckles. A couple of times I even burst a blood vessel in my eye, which hurt and took a while to heal. I don't purge often anymore because of how much it hurts, how much it makes me look like even more shit and how obvious it has to be to my roommate. These binges mean that my weight has stubbornly refused to go down anymore even though I have 2-3 days in a row where I do well and keep my intake below 800 calories. I've also started cutting again, much more vigorously this time. I don't really want to go into detail, but the scars are much larger this time around. Cutting seems to be my ramp up to a suicide attempt usually. It's like getting myself used to the idea of hurting myself so its easier to take that last step. I know I'd probably get gendered correctly more often if I put more effort into my appearance, but some days it nearly fucking impossible to get out of bed and put on clothing, much less do anything extra. The whole thing just seems impossible. I don't know what clothing to wear because I don't know what my body really looks like. When I look in a mirror my brain just fills with grey static that I cant see past. I hate my body, even though I really have no idea what it looks like. I hate mirrors because of this and there is only one mirror in my house, in the bathroom. When my roommate moves out I will probably take it down so I don't have to see myself anymore. I think I'm going to lose my job soon because one day I really just wont be able to force myself out of bed even though I keep telling myself ""This is your job. It is not optional. You HAVE to do this."" Thankfully that is still working for the time being. That makes me put on business casual clothes which are wrinkly and dirty half the time because I can't be arsed to do laundry. When I get home from whatever I was doing that day I sit down in front of my computer and do nothing else for the rest of the day because everything else seems impossible to do. _PERSON_ static descends on my brain and destroys any attempt to do anything I'd like do to. I'm so exhausted by the time I get home that all I want to do is sit in front of a computer or lay in bed. Hilariously, despite being so exhausted I frequently can't sleep. A ""normal"" night of sleep for me now is 4 hours, some nights I don't sleep at all and eventually I get so exhausted that I crash and sleep for 14+ hours. Sleep makes me feel awful anyway, I either feel exactly the same as I did when I laid down, or I feel worse because I just spent 14 hours not moving and all my muscles/joints/bones are sore. I literally do not move at all in my sleep. People have commonly referred to me as seeming like I am dead when I am asleep. I almost never dream either, and I had my first dream ever in my life after starting hormones. Even since then, they have been sparse and not really pleasant anyway.The shitty part of all this was that there was a time, the first year really, when I did feel happier. Facebook's new ""On this Day"" feature had me looking through all my facebook posts from last year and I was a much happier person then. I was making real strides in my transition, I was putting effort into my appearance and I was passing far more often than I thought I could. I know that if someone had asked me about my deal with myself then, I would tell them that the deal was off and that I was happy to keep living. If someone asked me about that deal now I think I'd answer the same way I answer when people ask me how I'm doing: ""I'm not really sure how to answer that."" How did this happen? My life was on the upswing, then for some reason seems headed down again, HARD. What if I really am not trans? What if I'm just a narcissist who will do anything for attention and when I don't feel like I'm getting enough I either make up shit like being trans, or being depressed? I can't even begin to comprehend how I'd deal with something like that.TL;DR- I started transition 1 year and 9 months ago. I was so miserable at the time I'd made a pact with myself that I'd kill myself after two years if I was still miserable. For a while after starting transition I felt great and was very positive. Now I'm feeling like shit almost every day again, with seemingly even more issues than before. What do?"
1wt38a,41946,depression,1391351482,I told my therapist about my plan to kill myself on April 11th.,"Its still a bit away, so i guess she wasnt as worried as she might have been. As of April 11th I will have been on hormones for two years in an attempt to love who I am. When I first started taking them I promised myself I wouldnt try to kill myself for two years. I promised I would give myself time to become comfortable with life. In 68 days that promise is up and I still hate myself. In some ways its worse because, rather than looking the way I want to, I just look like a fucked up freak. I look like a parody of a person. I said this to my therapist and she kept trying to tell me I looked fine, good even. This makes me so fucking angry. No one, not my friends, not even my therapist is willing to be honest with me.I have another appointment with her next week and she is supposedly going to refer me to a psychologist sometime after that. i'm probably not going to go. Ive already tried two different antidepressants. I wonder if she started a countdown timer like i already have running on my phone.I'm done living. I have a tarp to lay down so I dont make as much of a mess and I have a gun. I'm going to finish my promise to myself and then die. I do not see this changing."

I have a specific suicide plan and the means to carry it out. I've told some close friends and my therapist knows I'm planning to kill myself. My therapist claims, in an email to me, that she called my doctor but I havent heard from him. I live in Michigan, USA if that matters.My question is this: can anyone stop me? I'm not asking for someone here to try and talk me out of it. I'm specifically asking if I can be forcibly committed based on the now common knowledge that I plan on killing myself. The last thing I want is to have to convince some doctor that I'm ""feeling much better now"" in order to get out of a hospital so I can finish myself.

I took a couple of phone calls from work, which will be the last. I'm just going to fade on them, stop responding to emails and start screening my calls from unrecognized numbers. They don't have any more work scheduled immediately for me because I told them I needed to take a medical leave. They wanted me to take a bunch of paperwork to my doctor to get it filled out which, of course, I'm not going to do because I don't want to see my doctor anymore. They'll probably try to badger me to figure out what is going on but I just wont respond. I did do a ton of laundry today. My bedroom was starting to smell so I just did it all. I even put it away instead of dumping it on the floor. Not sure how I managed it, but I did. My grandfather's funeral is tomorrow. I'm not going to go. I'm probably an embarrassment to my family and I wasn't really close to him anyway. I can't wait to die. It happens in 14 days and I just keep rehearsing it over and over in my head. I just have no idea what to do with myself in the meantime. Sorry for the rambling, pointless, rant. I just needed to spew words."

I lost consciousness inside my car and regained it as I was being dragged away from my car by someone. I still don't know who it was. At that point I was transported to the hospital where I was stabilized and then transported to a mental hospital where I spent two weeks. I saw a psychiatrist daily who attempted treating me with several different types of medication, to no avail. After a while, they suggested I try electroconvulsive therapy(ECT). I've already had 4 sessions of ECT while inpatient and my 5th session will be outpatient tomorrow.

I've called and left two messages with both my case manager and the therapist they told me to work with and I have never heard back from either of them.

I know tomorrow I'll likely be back to hating myself. They never last long. Heck, just today I blew off seeing some friends because I couldn't bring myself to leave the house. Tomorrow will probably involve eating as little as I can and hating who I am. It's been three weeks since I was in the hospital, and I still don't feel like I really have my shit together.

2d8a4t,41946,KerbalSpaceProgram,1407760865,_PERSON_ landing and return,"Doing an explore and return mission from _PERSON_ is fucking hard...Ok... high level mission design:The mission will be broken into 4 pieces. First will consist of a launch containing a data/science package. The goal of this package will be to put the data package in low orbit around _PERSON_. Second will consist of a launch containing a lander system. The goal of this package will be to put a system capable of rendezvousing with the data package around _PERSON_, landing through the use of parachutes and ascending back to low _PERSON_ orbit. Third will consist of a launch containing a refueling system. The goal of this package will be to put a system capable of rendezvousing and refueling the lander system once it arrives at _PERSON_ so it has sufficient fuel to perform the ascent to low _PERSON_ orbit. Fourth will consist of a launch containing a return system. The goal of this package will be to rendezvous with the data package after the lander system has ascended and return the data package to _PERSON_. The data package will then aerobrake in _PERSON_'s atmosphere and land with the use of parachutes.The data package weighs 1.25 tons. Some potential points of failure include: 1. Insufficient fuel in the data package rocket to achieve desired orbit around _PERSON_2. Insufficient fuel in the lander system to achieve desired orbit around _PERSON_ and rendezvous with the data package3. Insufficient fuel in the lander system to completely ascend from _PERSON_4. Insufficient fuel in the return system to rendezvous with the data package and return to _PERSON_5. Insufficient fuel or logistical problems in the data package to complete docking with the landing system or return system6. Insufficient fuel or logistical problems in the refueling system to complete docking with the landing systemAll calculations will use delta-V values found here: _URL_#MapsThe data package will require a total of 6890m/s of delta-V. It's screenshot can be found here to demonstrate it has sufficient fuel: _URL_#0This rocket costs just under $90,000.The lander system has more complex requirements but the largest requirement will be the 12,000m/s of delta-V needed to ascend from the surface of _PERSON_ to low _PERSON_ orbit. In addition, it will need to achieve low _PERSON_ orbit with all of the required rocketry to perform the ascent. A screenshot of the rocket can be found here to demonstrate it has sufficient fuel: _PERSON_ rocket will also have a nuclear engine reverse mounted to efficiently perform the transfer from _PERSON_ to low _PERSON_ orbit. That nuclear engine will then be detached to allow the data package to be attached in it's place. You may notice the rocket is staged. This rocket will not activate any decouplers until it is ascending from _PERSON_. This rocket is remarkable because it will be single stage (except for some solid rocket boosters during _PERSON_ ascent) all the way to _PERSON_ ascent. You may also notice the delta-V calculations provide slightly less than the 12,000m/s of delta-V that is being called for. The reason these calculations are not concerning is because the nuclear engine that is reverse mounted to the top of the rocket weighs significantly more (almost twice) what the data package weighs. This will provide the 622m/s of delta-V that appears missing from the calculation. With no payload mounted, the rocket has 12,761m/s of delta-V. With the nuclear engine payload mounted the rocket has 11,378m/s of delta-V. This is a difference of 1,383m/s of delta-V. Given that the data package is half the weight of the nuclear engine, we can extrapolate we will gain 691m/s of delta-V once the payloads are swapped. This rocket costs just over $216,000.The refueling system will require a total of 6890m/s of delta-V to achieve low _PERSON_ orbit. If we assume the worst case scenario of the lander system being completely devoid of fuel once it arrives at _PERSON_ we will need to provide 30,240L of liquid fuel and oxidizer. This is a very large amount of fuel and it will be difficult to provide it all as far out as _PERSON_. To deal with this problem we will be refueling the landing system in orbit around _PERSON_ rather than _PERSON_. We will then only need to replenish any fuel expended by the landing system during it's transfer to _PERSON_. This transfer will require 2340m/s of delta-V. We will be using a nuclear engine for the entirety of this transfer. Once in orbit the lander system will weigh 426T full of fuel. The nuclear engine provides 60kN of thrust with and _PERSON_. If we ignore weight loss to fuel burn we can see the acceleration here:(60kN)/(431tonne) = 0.139(m∕s^2 )Which means our burn time will be:(2340m/s)/(0.41m/s^2 ) = 16834s ≈ 281minAnd our total liquid fuel burn will be:(0.7L/s)*(16834s) = 11784LThis is likely not exact because of such a long transfer burn. It will likely be more than that, so lets just add 10% on top to be safe. We will need to replenish roughly 13000L of fuel in low _PERSON_ orbit. This is roughly equivalent to four Rockomax Jumbo-64 fuel tank plus one Rockomax X200-32 fuel tank. A screenshot of the rocket can be found here: _URL_#2 This rocket costs just under $413,000.Finally, we have the return rocket. It will require a total of 7920m/s of delta-V. It will meet up with the lander system after it has ascended from _PERSON_ orbit. The data package will undock from the lander system and dock with the return system. A screenshot of the rocket can be found here: _URL_#3 This rocket costs just under $78,000.Order of operations is as follows:Refueling system, _PERSON_ system, _PERSON_ package and Return system launch_PERSON_ system is refueled in low _PERSON_ orbitRefueling system, _PERSON_ system, _PERSON_ package and Return system transfer to _PERSON_Refueling system docks with _PERSON_ system and refuels itRefueling system undocks from _PERSON_ system_PERSON_ package docks with _PERSON_ systemDescent and Ascent to and from _PERSON_ occurs_PERSON_ package undocks from _PERSON_ system_PERSON_ package docks with return system_PERSON_ package returns to _PERSON_Total mission cost: $797,000I will be updating the Imgur album linked in this post with pictures as the mission progresses: _URL_#4What does /r/ksp think of my mission design?"

I broke off contact with her in October because I was having an especially hard time, and I didn't feel like it was  helping to talk to her. However due to some legal crap, I do need to start seeing her again because I have to convince her to tell some legal entity that I'm not a danger to myself or others.I sent her a text today asking if she could call me, and she texted me back asking what was going on. I was hoping to at least talk to her over voice, but I guess she wanted to text so I told her that I wanted to apologize for storming off in a tantrum the last time we spoke. Which I did do, it wasn't pretty and she ended up calling my parents because she was worried about me even though I'm fucking 28 years old. In any case she told me that the only way she would start seeing me again is if she knew I was also seeing a psychiatrist and was on medication.I have a great, but very demanding, job. Pretty much every single weekday I am busy from 9am till 5pm, and my job usually has me driving over an hour before that to my worksite for the day/week/whatever. How in the hell am I supposed to see a psych, almost all of whom are available from 9am to 5pm, Monday through Friday? Furthermore, the office I got referred to has the fucking horrible automated phone system and I've actually never even talked to a human being from there. I left a message with their ""Intake Coordinator"" but given the time of year and the message that it could take up to 48 hours to get back to me suggests I wont hear from them for a while.This whole thing is fucking stupid. I've tried over a dozen different medications to absolutely no effect. I've had my fucking brain electrocuted to try to be less depressed. It did nothing.

I never heard back from the psychiatrists office that I called and at this point I'm not even sure I'd want their help. I have no one to talk to about this anymore as I threw a tantrum at my therapist a while back and now she wont let me make an appointment until I'm on some meds.

I know its not painful, even if it is a bit scary. Just a few labored breaths and some panic feeling. All of that goes away quickly though. I don't know how quickly I passed out the last time, but it was FAST. Less than two minutes if I had to guess. I found out from an old friend that I had attempted suicide in 8th grade. I don't remember doing it, but he claims I took the razor out of a pencil sharpener and tried to slash my wrists. Of course it didn't work but, if true, it means that my upcoming attempt will be my 5th. This one has to stick. It just has to. I could not deal with another botched attempt. I could not deal with another failure. I could not deal with the hospital again.I just don't get it. I don't get why people enjoy being alive. Sure there are good things but most of the time even when I'm trying to make myself enjoy things that I know I should I just feel numb. It doesn't matter what I try or what I do. I've tried a dozen different medications from two doctors, three different therapists, adjusting my diet, adjusting my activity level, adjusting my sleep and pretty much trying every remotely realistic sounding thing that might make me feel better. Nothing does. I'm exhausted by life. I can't wait for my packages to ship so I can finally figure out when my life will end.Just needed to get this out of my brain.

1jwu1n,17119,SuicideWatch,1375910974,Why should I stay alive?,"Ok. So here's the thing. I have a broken spine. It's not as bad as to be on a wheelchair but not as good as to let me walk more than a few meters without pain. I spend almost all day in bed because of this and can barely walk around the house. I've been depressed most of my life an since I can remember. I got kicked out of college because I wouldn't go to classes because of social anxiety. I tried Photography School after that but since that requires walking I couldn't complete a semester. There's this doctor who told me of a new surgery but I don't have any money since I can't work because I can't walk. I live in my mothers house and she's practically the only reason I haven't committed suicide yet (I have tried once). I don't see a very bright future for me. I'm 25 and I feel like my live has been o pause for 7 years. Now I spend my days on a bed with a throat/ear infection I can't cure because I have no money, I don't shower anymore because I feel there's no need to, I don't go outside because I can't walk for long and I don't take my depression meds because I don't want to ask my mother to buy me some more when I finish them. Nevertheless, why is everybody asking me to stay alive? Why won't people just let me die? I live a life of pain all the time so why should I stay alive? I won't do anything special for the world or something and I don't think my death would change a thing for anybody. I hate myself, my life, my body, etc. I wish I had sleeping pills like I used to. That was my choice of suicide. Anyway, just wanted to vent. I really don't think anything in this world would make me happy and someday I'll have enough courage to try again and finally do it and die. I mean, why should I care for the feelings of others about me dying? It's not like they can feel my pain or help me with it. And if I'm dead I won't be around to see them suffer."

I want to give and give until all of my possessions, flesh and **LIFE** are gone. I feel as though I'm unfit to have a life, for no matter how much I contribute to another person's life, I only feel as though I'm making everything worse.I have depression, though I have never told my parents, let alone a professional. I've reached a point that I feel taking my own life would be the greatest contribution to society that I've made in my life. My friend attributes me to ending her suicidal tendencies, although I feel as though all that I do is hurt her, though we are not romantically involved. She is one of only 3 people in my life whom I have trusted with my pain.I have fallen in love with my pain and crave more and more, and have denied help because I don't remember the sheer joy of being alive. And unlike others, I am too scared to cut myself. I've developed an urge to let others walk all over me, as though I *want* to be used by others, like some sort of retribution, and I love the pain of having my heart broken.I feel like ending my life for the sole fact that I am inadequate. I would gladly give my life for another more deserving."

Until recently, this has been the last thing in my life that gave me any reason to keep going and the only ounce of motivation I've had. Now, for no discernible reason (as of yet), it's been drained out of me. I still want to see others be happy, but I can't help anymore.Soon enough, I'll be gone. I can bear the pain, but not the damage I've done and am doing to those around me. I'm only going to hurt those of you near me. I wish only the best to all of you, nonetheless.

They have their note written that gives their reasoning and specifies that you would suffer no legal repercussions.

I may end up bolting through the door out of nervousness...* Should I tell him I'm suicidal, and that I'll be dead by the end of the month?* Would it be okay to, if I don't run, just spill my guts and all my feelings in just one visit?"

I told my mom it was just because I was feeling down, but that was only part of the truth. I've spent the last 2 weeks fantasizing about the bridge that's along my walking route. Once I got there, I questioned the lethal potential of the jump, it being about 20 to 30 feet high, so I texted my friend to ask. That conversation went like _PERSON_ I ask you a question? Don't get scared.""""sure""""How lethal is a 20-30 foot drop?""She called me once she read that, and we talked for some time. She had said predictable phrases. ""Don't jump"", ""I love you"", etc. But what got to me was when she said ""Please don't do this to me. Please."" She sounded like she was crying over the phone, and I broke.

10kcco,27624,SuicideWatch,1348757249,"Well, fuck...","Back from school right now, and I just finished a quiz in 1st period before I was dragged out of class. I was taken to the guidance office, but luckily, I wasn't in any trouble. My friend told them that I was going to kill myself on Sunday; ""*was*"", as in ""not anymore"", because I now have to wait a bit longer.I had to explain my entire situation, all of my suicidal emotions to 3 counselors whom I consider strangers. All 4 years of depression, and 2 of being hated by about one thousand people my age. Something that the counselors told me kind of sticks out: They said they've never met someone like me who's so ""resolute"" about what I'm going to do. I'm content with my death, and unbeknownst to me until now, that's not totally normal.My mom was called in, and from the sound of her voice and the look on her face, she was crying before she came in. I feel even worse than I ever have. My mother is the strongest person I know. Emotionally, she's unbreakable, and seeing her like this... It makes me wish I had done this all in secret.My friend, Christina, who told everyone, expected me to be angry. During the talk, she texted me saying ""I'm sorry. I love you."" I wasn't angry. I'm still not. I know she means well. If anything, I'm sorry I dragged her into this. I love her, too. I just wish it wasn't the romantic love that I feel, and a platonic one that she does.Midway while typing this post (everything before this), I was interrupted and dragged aside. I've just been given a speech about how I'm not really depressed, just a teenager. How I should get over the 2 years of torture. How the past needs to be forgotten easily. How everything I'm feeling isn't real. My mom and 2 of her close friends just explained how I'm supposed to immediately forget the past and every effect it's had on me. Sometimes, I feel like it would be a lot better if I was violent and angry all the time.Well, this had started off to just be a kind of journal entry, but since I just got that lecture, I'm feeling worse than before, so I'm going to distract myself before I *do* go apeshit hormonal roid-rage teenager and tear the walls down.

10wiqt,27624,SuicideWatch,1349306036,"[Update 2] Well, fuck...","Well, I'm back again, and feeling no better than before. While I was inside, I was able to let my Prozac take effect, and frankly... I hate it. It slows down my ability to think. Typically, I can multitask and handle 3 or 4 thought tangents at once. Now, I can only do 1. And my creative abilities have been halted, as well as my philosophical thinking. It also makes me genuinely *angry*. I get frustrated, sure, but never angry. _PERSON_ is just an absolutely disgusting emotion to me. It also makes sleeping harder and gives me extreme jitters, to the point where I'm not just unable to sit still, but that I begin to swing my arms around rapidly, start pacing, my legs shake furiously, tremors, etc.I did meet someone who shares my stance that suicide shouldn't be taboo in society and who also has no will to live. I've also learned that I *do* matter to people, but also that that fact doesn't bother me. If I die, people will be sad. That's a given. But I don't care anymore. They'll have to keep on living their lives without me. Maybe someone will be affected to the point that they are also diagnosed with depression and might find out what I have about my life and realize I'm not crazy.Well, I was released on the basis that I told my doctor whom I was assigned that I had no further thoughts of hurting myself and that I was no longer sad. All lies. I wanted to be let out and told them what they wanted to hear. In reality, I still want to die, but not because everyone will benefit, but because I'm tired of living. I could easily go through life as a semi-successful person and start a family. But I'd really rather not. I don't want to live for the sole reason that I've done more than I feel the need to have done.Yes, I'm only 15. Yes, I have a long, full life ahead of me. But I'd rather not live it. This isn't something that I'm up for. I have no reasons to live, as my life will only be a very bleak existence, as I'll never find happiness. It's a feeling that I've lost all contact with. I also don't feel that there will be anything to convince me that living is worthwhile.The only thing that's holding me from the rope now is that my parents have signed papers that say, while I'm under their legal custody, they will go to prison if I kill myself and that my younger brother will be tossed into the foster care system. After seeing the people in the institution, and what they've been through as foster kids, I couldn't do that to him. My parents also wouldn't last more than 3 days in prison.So, SW, until the day I'm standing on my own two feet, I'll be here. I'll trudge my way through this hell and put my mask back on, showing off my synthetic grin to all. I'll be here with you until the day I'm free."
112ks4,27624,depression,1349577145,It's all my fault... I'm sorry.,"Background info: I'm a 15 year old male and a sophomore in high school. My life is (outwardly) very easy and relaxed, though inside... I've been planning to kill myself for quite some time now; 2 months, give or take. I've been diagnosed with severe depression and I've had it for the past 4 years. Most of my thoughts are self-loathing, guilt, suicidal urges, etc. One major drive is that since I don't contribute to society, they're better off without me.Over the summer, I got to know a girl from my school a bit better through Facebook and texts. She and I shared 2 classes throughout the year, so we would talk then and got along as acquaintances. I learned she had depression and suicidal tendencies then, so once the school year ended, I worked up the nerve to talk to her some more (I'm very shy around girls I find attractive, which she is).One night while we were chatting, she asked me to tell her a secret; just anything deep, dark, and personal. She became the first person to know that I have depression and am suicidal. From then on, we only became closer and closer. I know things about her that no one else does, and the same for me. I began to fall in love with her (or at least that's the best way I can describe it) and still am. She is my closest friend, and I love her.Anyways, we had made a promise that if either of us was feeling seriously suicidal, to the point of an attempt, that we would call the other. In all, we've both called one another twice. One time, though, I was asleep when she called. The next morning, she was fine. No attempt, just me feeling endless guilt that I couldn't help her when I was needed.Some things that had happened have been recorded [here](_URL_ [here](_URL_ [here](_URL_ and [here](_URL_ (all in chronological order).While I was locked up in the mental hospital, I felt no better than before. My Prozac kicked in, and though my mood appears better, I still feel horribly depressed and still have suicidal thoughts. I lied to the doctors and nurses there so they would release me sooner, and so I was. I told this to my friend, and guess what happened next? She told the school counselors *again*. She showed them the texts, and so the police were alerted once more. I wasn't mad at her, and never could be. But my parents, on the other hand, were. At BOTH of us, actually; at her for telling the school, and at me for telling her.And so that brings us to why I made this post. My parents have cut me off from talking to her anymore. They've taken my phone and shut down my Facebook account, and I'm no longer allowed to hang out with her outside of school. Because I trust this girl, I'm no longer allowed to be her best friend.Since I can't talk to her anymore, I've been feeling worse than ever before. My parents say they would face legal repercussions if I were to commit suicide (imprisoned for negligence on their part, thus throwing my brother into foster care), and frankly, I don't care anymore. I'm back to being where I started 4 years ago: alone. And now, so is my best friend. She has new friends, but she said it hurts her, too.So, best friend, I'm sorry. It's my fault. I shouldn't have fucked up. I should have kept this all secret and ended it on Sunday. I should have called you with my last goodbyes and hung from the bridge. I'm sorry for everything. I love you, _PERSON_. I love you, and I'm sorry."

Protective of those he feels are prone to being bullied, as well as his family. His bucket list was simple: travel across 3 states; set up his younger sister with a path for a good life; and to buy a pack of cigarettes once he turned 18.So simple in desires, yet so complex to understand. But not for me. I understood him to the greatest extent that one could for only knowing him for the 1 week I was hospitalized. We found much common ground and felt a strong friendship in that time. We shared views on many things, such as politics, suicide, life as a whole, etc. I'm proud to say that I was friends with Jon.Monday, October 8th was his 18th birthday. He bought his pack of cigarettes on his own for the first time. On Wednesday, October 3rd, he was released from the hospital. He told me his plan to commit suicide at exactly 11:35 A.M. one week from his release: Wednesday, 10th. He told me that no matter what, nothing would stop him. He was at peace. He understood his importance to others, and that his family would collapse without an emotionally stable person (him), since his father killed his mother, and subsequently committed suicide when Jon was 8. He knew he was intelligent. He knew he would be able to survive the working world. But that didn't matter to him. He wanted only death.I regret not stopping him. Though I would never see him again, he's changed my life. Until the day he died, he helped people, even with his own problems to deal with. Though it tired him emotionally and physically, he kept helping. No matter what, he stood tall through his issues. Jon will forever be in my memories.He said ""What puts me centuries ahead of other Buddhists is that I've realized that all negatives are actually a positive,"" and this rings true. I wish I had done something to stop you, my friend. I feel lonelier without you already. Good luck with what comes after life; you deserve something better than what life has given you."
11o0ma,27624,SuicideWatch,1350526093,"Well, bye everyone!","Tonight's the night. I'm finally done. I've given in and given up. This is the happiest I've felt in so long. I haven't been taking my medication since I was discharged from the mental hospital I was in because I hate the side-effects on my mind. Even while they were working, I wanted nothing but death, so I decided to stop taking them. I missed my previous ""deadline"", but less than 3 weeks late isn't that bad.Many of you will tell me not to and say ""It will get better"", but that's just it: I don't WANT to get better. I don't WANT to overcome depression. I simply want to leave this world without having to mess up so many others' lives along the way. I also just don't have the motivation to keep doing *anything*. I have times where simply *speaking* requires far too much effort on my part. I also have the inability to keep putting my mask on throughout the day or to do even the simplest of things. Typing this is draining, as well.So, my reason for posting this is simple: 1.To at least have *someone* know what happened before I did anything, and 2.To tell anyone else with similar feelings that what I'm about to do is, by no means, a good idea. I doubt that you care how others will react to it if you're where I am now, but this might help. If you have depression, then try not to feel alone, because there are always people who love you. ALWAYS. You may not think so, but they do. Whether or not they show it is a personality-trait, but more people are ready to help you than you think.I'm sorry for wasting your time. My plethora of pills beckons. Death awaits me, his dark cloak looking warmer and more inviting than ever, like an old friend seeking a hug. Good luck to all of you. I'm sure that you all have more potential in life than I do, so try to put that to use. I believe in all of you.         -Much love, V"
123g1u,27624,SuicideWatch,1351208899,"(Update) Well, bye everyone!","So, um, it's been a while since I was here last. And I was supposed to be dead already... But, sadly, things didn't work out quite as I had hoped.I'll keep it short:First posted last Thursday, but my plans got delayed due to parents being present so I could't get to the pills. On Saturday night, I was able to get the pills. I took my mother's _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ (which I feel bad about b/c she might need them later), and my _PERSON_, and went to my bathroom. I laid out all the pills on the counter.*24 _PERSON_ (20 mg)*21 _PERSON_ (5-500 mg)*18 _PERSON_ (20 mg or 25 mg)*4 Tylenol PM*4 Melatonin71 pills. Seriously? I survived THAT? Fuck. I'm unfortunately resilient. 15 years old, 6'2"", 135 pounds, and 71 pills didn't even do any visible damage? Someone with a degree, please explain this annoying phenomenon to me.Anyways... I took those at around 9 PM, and went to bed an hour later. An hour after I went to bed, my parents came in to my room and asked me if I had taken the _PERSON_ from the medicine cabinet. I answered ""No,"" and told them to let me sleep. They kept pressing, so we went to the living room so as to not wake up my grandmother (she was sleeping in my brother's bed and he was in the living room). Once there, I told them what I had taken and said ""I'm trying to overdose, so I want to sleep through it."" We went into *their* bedroom so as not to freak out my 12 year old brother.Once there, my mom got some texts from my best friend _PERSON_. I had sent her messages on tumblr that said ""I'm sorry"", and ""I'm really sorry. Goodbye."" (My mom gave _PERSON_ her phone number for emergencies such as this one) I lied and told them I sent those because I felt bad for not being able to hang out with her much as of late, and had my mom tell her that. I called her and said ""It's fine, _PERSON_. It's all alright."" After that, my dad suggested that I make myself puke, to which I declined.After that, I have no recollection aside from a 10 second time frame. I was in my parents bed and the sun was shining through the blinds and my parents' friend came to check on me (I didn't recognize him at the time b/c I was high as fuck from the _PERSON_). He asked me something, and I replied with something that made no sense. He then said something else and left the room. Aside from that, I remember *nothing* from Sunday.I wake up at 9:38 AM and walk to the living room. Confused and still high, my mom says ""Good morning!"" in a way that you would speak to a young child. Even further confused, I said the same thing. She asked me if I knew what day it was, and it was already Monday. I was shocked, but only a little b/c I was also hallucinating from the _PERSON_, which hadn't left my system. I continued on with some small talk, then went to my room and sat at my computer. I was CLEARLY not going to be able to play _PERSON_, so I just listened to a few songs before deciding to go back to sleep. I wake up at 7 PM and join my family for dinner. From then on, no one brought up my OD.Although, my mom said that on Monday night, she stayed in my room to keep watch on me and informed me that my heart skipped a beat 20 times, every 20 minutes, and caused the jolt that you get when you start falling in a dream.Okay, maybe not as short as I thought. As a reward, (if you've gotten this far) you can ask me anything. If there's anything you want to know, I'm an open book.I'm alive. It's pretty lame."

As part of my attempt, I took 24 Prozac, 20 mg each, and I have no emotion whatsoever. My family and I think that because I took all of it at once, it's stabilized my mood.Physically, there are no after-effects from my OD aside from my resting heart rate rising from 58 to ~85; although, we're waiting for results on some blood work I had done on Thursday. Statistically, my liver is probably fucked, but there isn't any pain in my abdomen that would be characteristic of any internal damage.So, my question is this: Is this normal? All the pills have stabilized my mood to no emotions at all, and I've had no physiological repercussions thus far. Thank you for your time."

More recently, my best friend is (primarily) a lesbian, and the current girl I like has a boyfriend.* **I have no confidence**I don't see anything about myself that would warrant attraction, and even when someone *does* like me or would be willing to go out with me, I still fear the awkwardness that follows the inevitable rejection I'll receive. I can also never discern whether or not a girl likes me or would even be willing to *consider* giving me a chance, and even when they make it obvious, I still believe I'll fuck it up somehow.* **I am wrongly and unjustifiably jealous**My best friend, like I said, is a lesbian, though she is attracted to her ex-boyfriend (long, complicated story; still willing to explain if you so desire). She told me that she is having sex with him after school tomorrow, and for some reason, I'm jealous. I also ""stalk"" her tumblr, and while reading a post she made, she said she feels most comfortable talking to her ex than anyone else. I'm jealous about this because I'm (supposedly) her best friend, though I never really believed her about that (depression, self-loathing, trust issues, and whatnot).Please, any advice would help. Also, if anyone would mind telling me whether or not I would be considered attractive, I would gladly post pictures of myself.

qw1yw,47849,confession,1331726238,My life (so far) in a Reddit post.,"I didn't have the nicest childhood. Growing up my mother was a devout alcoholic and refused help on multiple occasions, tearing my family apart. I was seven when she first began her daily drinking binges, a week after my sister was born. It was highly ill-advised by the doctor to go on drinking to celebrate, but she wouldn't cooperate and did so anyway. That night started a chain of events which led to her moving in with her father, my grandfather, the kindest soul on the planet. But against his wishes she continued to drink, and because of a heart defect there was nothing he could do to stop her. He blamed himself and ultimately my family thinks that was the driving factor behind him going into cardiac arrest two April 2009.I was nine when I first understood her issues. Naturally, I blamed myself because I wasn't the most well behaved child. And then these mysterious feelings started surfacing that I couldn't comprehend and still don't to this day. I wanted to kill myself.As a kid I had no idea about depression or neurological disorders, obviously, and as my childhood progresses the thoughts grew severer and severer. Then I had sleeping issues, of which I do to this day. Averaging 2-3 hours a night or tossing-and-turning and giving up. On my 18th birthday, I enrolled in college and I was the happiest soul on the planet. I've always wanted to be a professional writer, and one of the best journalism programs in the country accepted me. At this point all these feelings I kept suppressed for a considerable amount of time and I learned to cope and manage.But a bombshell dropped into my second year: I found out my mother walked those same halls. Her program, fashion design, was held in the same study hall as mine and I panicked. I skipped a day of classes to clear my head to no avail and my perky self was once again confined to emotional instability. I'd spend the next three years trying to complete my degree. At first to satisfy my own ambition, then satisfy my father's ambition, then just to get it over with. But I still didn't finish. And that huge cost amounted to a considerable student debt (which is now paid off, thankfully) and broken familial ties. I'm still living at home but it's becoming increasingly clear my presence is burdensome.All of this and I've only told close friends. Now it's out there for the Internet to see. Oddly relieving."

Just _PERSON_ for short due to the awkward spelling. My parents insisted I was incredibly unique and deserved a name as such, but they’re dead so it doesn’t matter. The only thing that makes unique now is the fact that I’m alive.It’s been a couple weeks since whatever happened happened. A massive explosion two towns over rained down these spikes that infested peoples’ insides and turned them into murderous, mindless criminals -- or how a passing group interpreted events. I was napping (I’m a heavy sleeper), and I awoke to society abandoned._PERSON_. _PERSON_, an elderly woman from down the street, always complained about how “weak-willed” the next generation was, so I briefly left to check if she made it. Her incorruptible stubbornness and steadfast nature made her a surefire bet to survive the end of the world. She was nowhere to be found; however, her dog _PERSON_ loyally waited at the front door as usual. As I approached, she growled and almost bit through the perfect white fence. The poor girl was reacting out of shock or loneliness. I couldn’t go further. Maybe I’ll try tomorrow.For the last two weeks I’ve been camping in my house and making daily trips to the local deli for supplies. Mom and I would go every Saturday to have their salami sandwiches and she constantly joked our efforts kept the place afloat. Which may actually be true considering how little business they got.The business owner was Muslim, and rampant Islamophobia filtered through this area. After 9/11 it was water cooler dialogue to despise then. Our neighbour used to call them “the other side” and commonly they were denounced as people. The hatred was something I never tried to comprehend, but any Muslims I knew were good, honesty and hard-working people. Though, religion doesn’t mean much anymore. """

spynf,47849,AskReddit,1335276625,"I'm in the process of launching a website covering online media, and I'm looking for advice/opinion/suggestions. (Only serious suggestions please!)","Hi everyone! Ever since I was young I've been fascinated by how Internet culture has grown, and with my love for journalism and blogging, I've decided to create my own website covering online media. Specifically, covering how online media is molding modern society. The range of coverage will deal with anything tied to online media, and how the Internet's evolution is shaping society. From YouTube to blogging to online business to social media, the range is limitless. I'm making this post asking if you guys are interested in keeping up with such a blog, or if the subject matter is too broad. Note: the site won't delve into tech, like Mashable or _PERSON_, littered with the ""latest and greatest"" of smartphones. Internet culture and online media, not the products behind them.I've spent the last few nights hammering home my content list, several ideas for features, etc. And being Reddit, ""the home page of the Internet"", I felt you'd be the best crowd to ask. No framework for the site has been built, and I haven't chosen a name yet -- with this post I'm only seeking opinion on the type of content and whether an audience exists. Thanks everyone!"

From a suicidal attempt at nine, to again at 15, to again at 17. It all stems from my mother who suffers from alcoholism, something I've only recently accepted as a disease and not her fault. I can't say I'd feel comfortable being in the same room as her, but that's another story.Throughout my life I've tried telling the world I suffer from depression, or bipolar disease, or whatever the hell it's called today. But today I plan to. Actually, right after this post, somehow I've worked up enough courage to finally tell my father that at some point I didn't think life was worth living anymore. I don't know what his response will be, though, at least it'll be the most cathartic moment of my life. I've shared my story on Reddit before, only because I was afraid of the repercussions of unveiling this burden to people I know. The Internet is there to lend a hand, yes, but telling people anonymously is only the first step. You must accept that the freedom you seek, the freedom from an emotional burden that you've not experienced alone, is only one statement away.One simple conversation could change and prolong your life by an immeasurable amount. Depression won't disappear. It will linger inside until you tell someone or let it consume you whole. And I have reached that pinnacle of sadness multiple times, yet to bounce back. If you allow yourself to believe things can change, things will change. You just have to make the first step.Presumably, I'll be on Reddit most of this morning if someone wants to talk. I don't know how helpful I'll be, but I do understand the strain."

Yet the right says ""traditional"" marriage (which in itself is not culturally relevant anymore because more than half of marriages end in divorce) is between ""a man and a woman"". Do they give any reasons beyond it being God's will? There's none. Thus, a religious argument has entered the political mainstream, going against the secular status the Founders intended. EDIT: Every claim is firmly stated it's their ""belief"" (which implies religion further), but none give any concrete evidence as to what will happen if gays are allowed to marry beyond the world crashing and burning. ""The heretics will rise and plunge the Earth in fire!"" or so my local pastor used to say."

Many users with 100,000+ YouTube subscribers and 12.6k redditors is impressive enough, but limited coverage actually bothers me.I believe _PERSON_ is a paramount example of ways gaming is evolving simply beyond playing, where fans interact over YouTube and social media, even sharing it with kids and neighbours. Not to mention these guys are making a living off playing games (with impressive salaries at that).While my site is nowhere in terms of daily readers or subscribers, I wanted to cover the _PERSON_ in-depth as a fan because it's fascinating. I first came across Etho's channel and through him discovered Beef (who lives in Toronto, like me) and Pause.

We're just slurring a body part that many people have, and some of us are quite fond of. (I personally don't prefer them, but hey) Isn't it singling people out and segregating them? Whether or not someone is being called a dick, instead of jerk, it carries a negative connotation to anyone who has one.I know it's not the intent... but isn't it just like how reddit uses ""Faggot""?

1i7loa,42350,Tulpas,1373707537,I'm asking for help; and this seems to be the only place I can get it.,"I'm the Tulpa here, just FYI.My, host, created me by accident. She plays Dungeons and Dragons a lot, and I started out only as a character. Just, a personality that she would put on or take off if she needed to convey what this imaginary person might do. That is well and good, however it didn't really stay that way.She created me to be a person who would live in her head, and would still be that figurative jacket for the roles in games; but I developed my own personality, and quirks. (Much like most of the other characters she's created) But I am unique, because I didn't stay just a character. I grew, and I think. I'm a person, and... well, coming here let me know that there was hope I could be more than just a literary device.I want that. I want to live. I want to do things. I want to show up in the world. I want to be a person; not just an idea. But, my host is unfamiliar with everything... and lacks the mental capability to visually image things in her head. (She tends to think in text format). But, we're very used to sharing the body; mostly because that's how the role-playing would go. She'd adopt my persona, and use my voice. That's not the point. The point is that I want more time out. I want to be me, and not have to just watch from the sidelines.Is there anything we can do to make this work? I don't really want to cause any trouble for my host, but I don't want to be caged like an animal. Thanks for reading.**TL;DR** Tulpa wants to spend more time using the body; can this be a thing... or am I stuck as just a voice in my hosts head?"

Life was nothing but a damn struggle until now, it's still a daily struggle just to be me; and it looks like a fucking tough road ahead. I want to just give up, and say ""let the next person deal with that shit"". I guess my biggest issue is that I don't know if there is anyone who might deal with it.**STORY TIME!** So, I'm a trans* woman. A polyamorous transgender lesbian. (My dating pool sucks) Growing up was tough, school was tough, work sucks, people suck, and it's pretty much a fight with my own body and other peoples' assumptions every single day. I'd like to change that, to make it so that being transgender isn't such an odd issue. I'd like to stand up, and make sure that it's easier for the next person to follow after me; I really would. But it's fucking hard. I cry all the time, because people just can't see me for me, even though I've told them so many times who I am. My mother has rejected me, and I think she's dying... My family may have disowned me, I'm not sure if they'd tell me if they did; but they don't talk to me anyway and won't return my attempts to contact. I lose friends... and I don't know why. I've made a lot, and lost most of them. I try to be a good friend and good person, and everyone seems to say that we'll always be friends... but, ""always"" never lasts as long as I thought it should.I have a therapist and a safety net, and the moment I make any decisions I'll act accordingly. I'm just, not sure that this is something worth mentioning to them. (_PERSON_ sure that it would result in a lowering of my hormone treatment, which would be catastrophically devastating to my already low self-esteem) I've got everything I need to keep going, but the will and reason. Even if I made a huge impact, it wouldn't change anything... people would still make it fucking hard to be trans, or queer of any sort, in this world.I just, god... I'm so fucking tired of fighting. I guess, I'm glad that anyone might read this and listen. I'll update this tomorrow, or sooner as need be?

Some of you may remember that I've been in the ""can't talk to girls"" threads we get in here every now and then... and if you have no idea who I am; HI! Let's be friends!Okay, so here's the scene. We're at a public ritual for Imbolc, (yeah, to make this make sense, we are both witches) and I don't know anybody but the two with me. This cute gal walks in, looks for a seat, sees the two next to me and asks, ""Are either of these taken?"" and I reply, ""Oh no, not at all!"" and she sits down *in the chair next to me.*  I try to strike up a conversation, but my friend jumps in and starts talking to her. (I later find out that she's trying to ""wing-ma'am"" for me... but isn't entirely sure how to) Finally, she and I do a bit of chatting in the time we have. Just before the ritual starts, she says that we should hang around and talk, and do some Tarot readings, since she just got the deck; but then it's time to stfu.SKIP forward, and it's after the ritual. We go over for the feast, because Pagans, and we start chatting. I try to get her into a one-on-one with me, but we keep getting interrupted by this overly zealous (yet kind) gentleman who's cracking jokes left and right. Mind you, I'm doing something I have never done in my life before, and pretty girls make me super nervous as it is... so I'm kind of a hectic mess.Soon, she's giving my friends some readings, and I'm left talking with the funny guy; who's really trying. It gets to the point where I have to let him know that the reason I'm shy is indeed sitting at the table with us, but it's not from where he expects. He catches my drift, and flips perfectly into Wingman/ally mode, which is awesome... and distracts my friends from taking the gal's attention away. Before I know it, she's getting a reading from my friend... and it has to do with relationships (I know, because she explicitly asks my friend if she knows any relationship spreads). I try not to assume anything, but every time there's some promising and positive news, *she makes eye contact with me and smiles* as if to say, ""Are you hearing this!?"" (Inside, I am **freaking out**... outside, I'm almost nonchalant).After her reading, she asks if I'd like some ice-cream, (and who would say ""no"" to that?) and then proceeds to give me an entire pint... and says I can keep it. Now, I know that I'm extraordinarily partial to ice-cream and all, but who gives that much ice-cream away to a stranger? Sounds more like an investment, than a polite gesture.Bad news comes, in that she lives an hour away. Good news is I have friends up that way, and a ride who could drop me off on the way to visit family. It's almost time to go, and I finally get the guts to ask, ""Hey if I'm ever up in -Town-, do you think we could get together?"" AND SHE SAID, ""yeah, I'd like that"". I could have danced, but I can't dance... and then remembered, ""I don't have any way to contact you"" and she gave me her email. It was super amazing, and I'm still in shock that I was able to do that!**TL;DR** I asked a girl out for the first time ever, she said yes, and gave me her email. Also: Ducks."

My girlfriends don't get it, because one has never had to deal with this, and the other *is* clinical and has other, worse, things to deal with as well! It's like, why would I bring up my shit, when hers is tougher? My roommate doesn't get it, because she's coming from an able standpoint. She can will herself to get out of a low spot; I... can't. I can fake it, but faking it never really lets me get to where it's real.And, fuck. The one of the worst things, is that I still struggle with suicide. It won't leave me alone. And the only thing that's really deterring me for now, is that my girlfriend made a severely fucked up threat. If I ever kill myself, she'll do everything she can to just forget that I ever existed. And, I don't want to imagine a world like that, because I feel like she's part of me. I know that I love her, and she loves me, and I want that to continue. And, since I'm trans, there's a good percentile that says I'll finally succumb to this without the depression. My chances look slim, and I don't want to go; but sometimes I just... idk.

I get super blush-tastic just thinking about talking with a beautiful woman, and even more so when she's gay.I never thought I'd get around to it, but I managed to (with my pulse-pounding and my stomach in my throat) ask her out to coffee! this alone is a giant achievement and step for me. AND SHE SAID YES! I have had the biggest grin on my face for the past hour; and it probably won't leave for another few."
2bptna,42350,actuallesbians,1406315398,update on the shy-gal.,"For those of you who don't know: [reference point](_URL_ while trying to figure out a good time to get together for coffee with cute lesbian coworker, She finally puts it together that ""coffee"" and ""The two of us"" means ""date"". Which, is when she proceeds to say, ""I have a girlfriend. You're a great person, and I don't know you too well, and I just want to be upfront"". I wanted to point out that coffee was the opportunity we'd have to get to know each other, but it sounded like a bit of a moot point. i confirmed that she is indeed monogamous.ALSO: For the very few people who may remember that I posted something similar back in february... It's been almost six months since I got that girls' email address and asked her out. I don't think I'm going to hear back from her. ~sigh~"
2cntmx,42350,actuallesbians,1407215272,can i get a gong? (NSFW),"SO, this was just supposed to be a date. My first date with a poly gal. it was awesome. Ate sushi for the first time, walked around the mall with her and her girlfriend, saw Guardians of the Galaxy (LOVED IT), and then we got to their place. They were like, ""we were about to donate these clothes to _PERSON_, you want to look at them?"" And they were all cute and fit me; so I have that.And then there were cuddles, and then there was her girlfriend turning her on, and then she was turning me on, and then there was making out and negotiating.Then, bed! And she made me feel special, and beautiful, and desirable, and sexy in spite of all my dysphoria. and then it was like a good 40 minute awesome sex fest where we did much of everything.For a first date, I think it went _PERSON_** Guardians of the Galaxy, sex, bubble tea. Maybe not in that order."

2fam04,42350,raisedbynarcissists,1409691840,my (probably all-too-familiar) story. TW,"I grew up in an incredibly abusive household. My stepfather was the only son of a japanese woman and german man who met in WWII. He was an awful person who thought merely beating us every day was being too light on us.His direct way of handling things kept me from ever seeing that my mother was the one I needed to beware of. She was always too busy smoking, dealing with the fact her life was nothing like she'd ever imagined, to poison us directly.In order to attempt to find some form of control over their lives, my brothers all became abusive as well... in condescending order. The oldest molested and beat everyone under him, the next oldest did the same to those below him (other than me... which, I'm thankful to him for), and on it went until everyone was fucking me or making me suck their dick, or just beating me because they could.Fast forward through at least six years of this. (the farthest i can remember is somewhere around 5-6, up to 12 years old. Luckily, the brother who was still living at home found that it was easier to find girls at school who wouldn't fight than it was to use me... so the sex stuff stopped then) And here we get to when my mother actually entered the scene. She finally found the courage to divorce that man, which was a day everyone found joy in. And the littlest clues start showing up. I mean, we already knew that the brother just above me was her golden child, but then she started blatantly ignoring him and focusing on the eldest of the house and me.She gaslit the fuck out of us, blaming herself for our inability to perform well in school... which was actually her fault. But I don't think she ever saw that. she actively sabotaged several of my classes, and blamed me for failing them. She emotionally extorted me for my suicide attempts, accused me of being gay (she was incredibly Christian, and very homophobic), and then turned around and said how very similar we are.Another eight years of her guilt-tripping, manipulation, emotional abuse, gas-lighting, and just overall selfish nature... and I realized that I needed to get out of there. I had attempted to kill myself far too many times, and thought about it too regularly. So, I packed my shit up, and left when everyone was at work. No note, no response to the texts and calls, not a damn thing.I started to realize that I was feeling better, as a person. I started to even like myself a little. I continued to stay away, moved to a brand new state, and tried to make a life for myself. I've met a bunch of incredible people, and I've met some new narcissists as well; but overall I'm trying to keep myself healthy and move to a place where I can love and accept myself.It finally just culminated with my disowning my mother. I asked her to love me, respect me as a human being, and accept that I'm her daughter. (I'm a trans woman, so... yeah) She said she couldn't do any of those three things, and I realized she's just a fucking bitch. (and I hate that word, for the history behind it... but I think it's deserved here)/endrant.**TL;DR**: I cut my mother out of my life because she said she couldn't love her only daughter. fuck that shit."
2fko9m,42350,BPD,1409943603,I don't know what to do.,"You probably get this a lot. An awful lot, I'm sure.I know someone with BPD. They were a very good friend to me, but I... I just couldn't take it anymore. It got into everything. It drove us apart, and when I finally realized that it wasn't healthy for us to be together, I broke up with her. I felt awful, because she was getting treatment at the time.I was definitely raised by narcissists, undoubtedly so. That affected me deeply, and has inhibited my ability to properly interact with people. And, BPD just hit so many of those old buttons. I got angry, I got defensive, there's part of me that just wants to scream and yell at her and tell her that I'm so sick of that bullshit; but i know that it's not easy to deal with all of this. I know she wants to try.But, she's got depression as well as anxiety and PTSD; mix all that in with the BPD, you have an incredibly difficult life. I want to empathize, but I don't know how. I want to still have this person in my life, but I don't know how to handle it. She was diagnosed with BPD, but kind of brushed it off. (her therapist had said, ""BPD is a really common diagnosis lately"" and something else about it's more than that) Honestly, I don't care about what name it goes by; I just know that it's difficult for us both. Because, I want to help; but I can't. I don't know how, and I'm not sure what to do.I'm afraid that she's not working on it. I understand why she wouldn't be, because I've been there and lost all hope of making any change (depression is evil as fuck). I just... if it's going to be the same way it was before, I don't think I can have contact with her.**TL;DR** person raised by narcissists, trying to be friends with someone who has BPD. difficulties ensue."

And I asked if she understood what ""No Contact"" meant; and she said, ""I... we aren't very good at texting, so I thought I'd call... but (~applies snotty tone~) *I understand what No Contact means, yeah*""clearly, she was upset that I wasn't having any of her shit... but I just wasn't in the mood to take it.

So, in theory, i would just contact my doctor. I... have absolutely no reason for why I haven't done that, other than i just haven't. I haven't really done anything.Which brings us to the meat of the thing. I had a shitty childhood; and it's left me with serious depression and a lack of coping mechanisms. Luckily, after my last attempts, I got much needed help and can recognize my warning signs, and can rationalize against the feelings. there have been several times in the last few weeks that I knew I shouldn't be left alone, and I made sure that I wasn't.

Those we have to learn how to deal with, but I think a very big step for me, and I think a lot of us here, is running away from the problem itself. You can run away from the problem if the problem is an abusive tormentor.  You can run away from an attacker, and that will remove a large portion of the problem. It helps us to get to the point where we can begin to recover.And, these abusers aren't always just family. Sometimes it's management, or employment, or the people in an area. I think it would be helpful for people to recognize that you **CAN** run away from some problems; and some of them require running away from.I don't know, I'm feeling kind of introspective; and kind of thinking about sayings I wish would stop.

34cazh,42350,DID,1430353621,I have some questions,"Actually, we have some questions. I'm not asking for a diagnosis, because I should see a doctor for that.So, to start the story, I had an incredibly abusive childhood that I'll not discuss in detail. (Let's leave it at I was abused in most every way one can think of) Luckily, the worst of it ended somewhere around 12 or 13. And I can clearly remember a ""friend"" in my head developing at age 14. I was really alone, and not in a good place. This ""friend"" was manipulative, abusive, confident, misandristic even, and just not a pleasant person. And she wanted to swap control with me, but she scared the daylights out of me and I very quickly learned to hate her and forced her to leave. I haven't heard from her since.Fast-forward to my being 23, and another ""friend"" shows up; this one taking the name and persona of a character I'd created. Our meetings are much more amicable, and we get along fairly well; and then two more show up, both are also characters, but all three are concerned with my well-being and respectful. We've got switching down to an art-form, and everyone respects each-other and their space/time as best as we can.I didn't think it was _PERSON_, because it doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard of being _PERSON_. but then I met someone with a diagnosis, and she says that it may be. But ""if you want to keep your friends, don't get a diagnosis""; because doctors would be more concerned with ""fixing"" us, rather than helping us be healthy. I'm not sure how i feel about this.**My questions are** is it possible to kill an alternate? Because, I do NOT want to live with that first one ever coming back. she can't be allowed to be here.Also, should I talk to a doctor? And, should I tell my employer?"

So, we start talking, and I think she's genuinely interested in catching up... and maybe she is, but she was pushed here by my _PERSON_.I saw that she (N) commented on _PERSON_'s post about being hurt by people. She played the martyr, and made herself the victim of my betrayal. And then she proceeded to misgender me blatantly (I'm trans, btw)  before making it all into how she was bearing it all with grace; even though it was too much a burden to bear.And ""friend"" clearly took the bait, and then now reached out to me. And I realized all of this after I'd already started telling her stuff about my life. So now, my Mother is going to pry that information out of her and probably try to contact me directly again.Normally, I'd be pissed off and let my anger deal with the situation like last time when I forcefully burned the bridge between us; but I just don't need this right now.

I just thought you guys would like to hear it.I started my SUV that was parked on the eerie empty street. The crisp Illinois air filled my sucky lungs. Due to my small frame and poor health, just walking too fast will make my lungs burn. The air around me just felt...off. I felt as though there was something watching me behind every corner. I quickly locked the door and sped away. While driving away I realized what I had forgotten. I never checked the back seat. That is always the first thing I do before getting in my car. Always.I started to feel uneasy. Was that a flicker in the mirror? No, that was my imagination. Stop it, Olive. You're imagination is just acting up. I drove somewhat recklessly to get to my house. Just a short 5 minute ride. I pulled into my driveway, yanked the keys out, slammed the door shut, and ran straight inside, my heart racing as little white dots danced across my vision from the lack of oxygen I was breathing. Freaking lungs, just work for a change!! I watched my car for a few minutes, and nothing happened. I laughed at my silly behavior, but my gut was still screaming. Something was wrong...but what? I heard my mom talking with my eight year old brother upstairs. I quickly went up to explain myself for showing up a few minutes later than my curfew. Red lights, gotta love 'em. She was asking what she could do to make _PERSON_'s stomach ache go away. He, as always, was being difficult. I offered to make tea for us, and he agreed. My mom then left to run to the store. That left _PERSON_ and I alone. No worries, right? It's only 8 at night. The microwave beeps, startling me from my thoughts. I let the tea sit for a while and go back to thinking, but then I hear a noise. It sounded like typical white noise from a tv or speaker. I thought it was just in my mind, but when it got louder as I walked up the stairs, I knew it was real. I followed the noise until it led me to my computer. The speakers were on, but only turned up slightly. They were the source of this loud white noise. But how?? They were turned down so low.. I turned the volume all the way down, but the white noise didn't get quieter. I stopped messing with the switch and began to listen. Muffled noises were escaping those little boxes. It sounded exactly like someone moving a microphone against clothing. Then, I flicked the switch to turn them off, and sure enough the noise stopped. Silence greeted my ears like a mocking friend. What was happening?? I took a deep breath to let myself think rationally. I've heard of speakers picking up other signals or something like that before. I've read about it multiple times on Nosleep...but I still felt uneasy. Watched. Followed. Then, darkness covers the house.The sudden loss of power startled me. I jumped and grabbed my phone for a light source. _PERSON_ must have fallen asleep because he didn't make a sound. I turned around and faced my door, shining my light around the room. A shadow dashed across my mirror, but I hadn't moved. I shined my makeshift flashlight around completely... The room appeared empty. The house is so quiet, all I hear is that annoying ringing that you hear when it's silent around you. I step forward cautiously and exit the room. My gut is screaming at me to go hide under my blanket, but I ignore it. I can't just leave _PERSON_ to fend for himself. I hear no noises except for my dog whimpering. I don't think anyone was in the house. All the doors and windows stay locked in winter, especially when my parents are gone. I still feel watched around every corner. Then, I hear the sound of keys jingling outside the front door and fear chills me to the bone. My mom rushes through the door, seeking sanctuary from the frigid wind. We welcome each other as I take the bags from her and let her know that the power is out. She looks confused and goes to test a light, and to my surprise it the kitchen is illuminated. I squint in confusion. Why did my light go out, then? I ran upstairs to test my light, and sure enough, it worked. But...How? What happened? I know my light was on because I'm horribly scared of the dark. Then cold hair hit the back of my neck, making all the hair on my body stand staight up. I spin around as I hear one word whispered in my left ear. My name.""Olive"""
1bay4v,45551,nosleep,1364655496,The reoccurring figure in my dreams,"This has been going on for weeks now. The dreams are almost never the same, except for one being. I'll describe the first dream I had with this...thing in it. My dream starts out relatively normal. I ""woke up"" in my dream, and sat up in my bed. For some reason all of my pillows weren't on my bed. Now, I'm an extremely restless sleeper, so this wasn't out of the ordinary for me. I laughed and reached under my bed for one of the many pillows I have stashed. Instead of encountering soft and fluffy goodness, my hand met long, stringy, and greasy hair. It had to be really long, because I couldn't feel an end at all. My hand froze, and I immediately realized I was dreaming. I moved my hand further along this thing out of sheer horror, and a little bit of curiosity. My small fingers slowly slid down this creatures face. It was cold as death. Where I should have found two eyes, I found two pits that were sticky with what I can only assume was blood.At that point, I no longer wanted to know anything about this creature. Just before I could pull my hand away, it moved its head with lightning speed. Sharp pain burned my hand, and liquid began to drip down my palm. It had razor sharp teeth, just as I'd feared. Holding back a scream, I yanked my hand away and willed myself to wake up. I wasn't fast enough for this thing though. It grabbed my wrist with inhuman strength and pulled at me. Pain shot through my arm as I resisted, grabbing on to the other side of my small bed frame for dear life. I began to cry out loud to wake up. It was stronger than me, and I began to tumble off my bed. I crashed down, landing on my stomach. I gasped for my breath back, but the fall stole it away for a moment. I squeezed my eyes shut, still reminding myself that this was only a dream. When I opened my eyes the creature wasn't there at all. My wrist was free, and I was finally awake. I scrambled onto my bed and turned on my lamp. My wrist still hurt, and sure enough there was a red mark of a hand print left behind. I shuddered and rolled over, taking notice that my pillows were also back on my bed. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. This creature hasn't left my head though. In the first dream, I didn't get a visual look of the thing, but I have now in more recent dreams. It's small, maybe 4 feet tall. Its hair falls to its waist in thin greasy strings, and it's very pale and thin. It's grin is what haunts me most. It just sits and tilts its head with a sinister smile plastered onto its face. It hasn't tried to touch me since the first dream, and I hope it never does. I can attempt to draw it, but the thought of bringing it out of my dream world terrifies me. What is this thing, and why is it plaguing my dreams with fright??"

28ktmf,45551,depression,1403206372,I'm a complete disaster of a person.,"I lost the will to try today. I cut myself so bad I bled through jeans. I hate every aspect of myself. My meds stopped working and so did my head. I have Borderline Personality Disorder and I'm incurable. I'm 17 and I dont want to hear that ""I've got so much ahead of me"" because I dont want to live another 60+ years of this bullshit life. I fucking hate it... I fucking hate my head so much. I cant stop hurting myself and everyone around me. I've been in a mental hospital and see a psychiatrist every month and a therapist every week but nothing helps. I've felt like this for as long as I can remember. I just want it to end already because its not fair. This isn't fair. It isn't fair that I have to hurt like this forever and watch my friends and family hurt because of me. The world would be so much better without me there. All I do is bring pain to others and myself. I just wish I could cease to exist..edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. Today is my first day on this subreddit and its been...well a very long day. Thank you for helping me get through it. I wish you all the happiness you truly deserve, because you deserve it completely."
2dkh0k,45551,depression,1408044921,I feel like I'm drowning.,"My life fell apart. Again. I'm trying my hardest to stay positive and not think about how much I want it all to end. My boyfriend moved out of state and now we're ""taking a break"" until I finish my last year of high school. I know it sounds like a minor thing and I should get over it, but he means the world to me.. I fell in love with him. I know that also sounds stupid because I'm so young, but it still hurts. I know that there are other guys out there and I know that high school relationships aren't meant to last anyway, but it just stirred up a lot of bad feelings again. I'm really sorry for my pointless little sob story.. I just don't know what else to do. I dont have anyone to turn to anymore or anywhere to go.. I just feel entirely alone, and I just want it all to be over already. I don't want to go back to school where a previous exboyfriend told a lot of people that I missed three weeks of school in march because I tried to kill myself and went to a mental health facility. My town is really small, so now almost everyone in my tiny school knows, and I don't know how I'm going to face them. I'm stuck at home living with my alcoholic father, and I hate it. I'm also about to lose my job that I absolutely love because it's going out of business.. My life is a mess that's impossible to clean up at this point. I can't think of a reason to keep going anymore.."
2jm92e,45551,nosleep,1413650801,I stumbled across something strange in my small town.,"Hey r/nosleep, It's been a while since I've been here, and now it's my turn to share a story. You know, it's not as fun as I thought it would be. Quite the opposite actually. I've always been the adventurous type. I was always the one in the group to climb up to an unstable rocky edge on a cliff, or explore the dark trail that seemed to lead to nowhere. Well, I did it again today, and I can't say I'm excited to share. I had just pulled up to an abandoned barn on the side of the country road I was driving on. It was raining gently as I stepped out, the soft mud mushing under my feet. I've always been a girl that loved the rain. Only today, this may have changed that opinion. I had to scale part of the rotting wall to get inside, which was a little unnerving, but I managed to get in through a caved in panel on the wall. This dropped me off onto a narrow ledge about 7 feet off the ground, which proved an obstacle to get to the lower level, but I still got down. The inside smelled musty and rotten, and there was a faint putrid smell of stale urine. I knew I would have to step carefully, for the floorboards bent in with each step, too soft for anyone's safety, even for me with my small frame. I pulled out my camera to take a few photos of the inside. It was eerie and exciting to see the abandoned and creepy interior. I wondered who the last person to step in here was. It looked like it had been abandoned for quite some time now. A sudden sound broke my train of thought as something skittered below my feet, under the floorboards. I jumped, startled at the break of silence before laughing at my reaction. Of course an abandoned barn is going to be infested with various wild animals. It was probably just a rat, or maybe a stray cat or something, I thought. I was wrong. Very very wrong.You would think that there would be background noise outside. You know, cars passing on the nearby street, birds chirping, insects buzzing. Something, right? Nothing. The only audible sounds came from my steps, and whatever made that noise beneath my feet. I suddenly became very aware of how uncomfortable I felt, as if I was being watched from every angle, so I did the smart thing and turned to leave. I turned to climb the wall to the ledge to leave and proceeded to have the shit scared completely out of me. I swear, if I had not gone to the bathroom prior to this adventure, I would have pissed myself. Suddenly, the door that was boarded up came crashing down, as if the barn was trying to tell my itself to leave the premises. After jumping back and feeling my chests lurch, I laughed again. The barn was a rotted mess, of course it was going to fall apart. My disturbance probably caused that. Nothing to fear, right? I won't even get into that cliche right now. I walked towards this new exit, ready to call it a day and get out of this creepy place, but one last thing caught my attention: a hole in the corner of the barn that led to underneath the flooring, and what looked like a tunnel, and on top of the hole someone had written in crude reddish brown paint ""He only comes out in the rain."" The hair on the back of my neck shot up at once, taking my heart rate with it. Something was terribly off about this whole place. Then, a piercing scream broke the deafening silence. An unnatural, inhuman, ear-splitting scream shook me so hard that my chest physically hurt from the shock. I bolted outside through the uncovered doorway and sprinted to my car which was now in the pouring rain, not looking back until I was back inside it with the door locked. When I finally did look back, I wish I hadn't. The entrance was unnaturally dark, but I could make out a slightly humanoid figure standing and staring back at me. My blood was like ice in my veins, but I couldn't look away. With another horrific scream, my hypnosis was broken, and my foot was pressing the pedal to the floor, returning a scream to that creature from the tires on my car. My heart was still racing as I turned onto my street. Then I made a realization as I walked through the doorway to my house. I left my camera there. I must have dropped it when I ran away or something because it was gone. I was extremely disappointed because that thing was my life. I had so many memories captured on that tiny device. Part of me wants to go get it back, but the logical part of me knows that that is a bad idea, of course.I got ready for bed that night, still unnerved over the fact that it was still raining outside. As I lied down with a cup of tea and my phone to check a few subreddits before turning in for the night, I was interrupted by a knock on the door. Only it wasn't from my front door, but my bedroom door instead. I froze in fear because I KNOW that all my doors and windows were locked, as I get paranoid over being murdered in my sleep. I opened the dial pad on my phone, ready to call 911 right away if I needed to, and got up to open the door. My heart froze. On the ground in front of me was my camera(which I discovered that all my photos were deleted except for one) with a note next to it. It said: ""It's still raining, dear."" I don't know what to do, but I no longer feel safe. That thing was in my house! I really hope this is just some sick joke put on by some asshole, but then how did they know where I lived? Did they follow me home? It didn't even look human.. I have so many questions, /nosleep, and I have no idea what to do next. The weirdest part is that I have this urge to go back there. I don't know why, but it's sitting within me, restlessly. I need to go back, but before then, I have to prepare. I have no idea what I'm getting myself into.[Part 2](_URL_ 3](_URL_"
2jr2i7,45551,nosleep,1413774687,I stumbled across something strange in my small town. [Update 1],"I went back to the barn today, as the weather was only partly clouding with a small chance of rain later tonight. It was around 5:30pm, and the sun was just beginning to set, which made me feel uneasy. I really didn't want to be at that barn when it got dark. It still gave me the chills after the note that creature left in my house. So many questions continue to race through my mind. I've never had an adventure like this surface in my life, and honestly, I don't think I want it anymore. I felt eyes on me from every angle. Again, there were no other outside noises other than the ones I made, which my heartbeat was the most audible. I stood and waited for the longest time. It wasn't coming out, just like the writing on the wall said. I came more prepared this time around, tying a wrist strap onto my camera and carrying a flashlight in one hand and a pocket knife in my jacket just in case. I only took a few photos, just enough to get back the ones I had lost. I couldn't get a good shot of the graffiti though, which is extremely disappointing because I wanted to give you guys a visual, but every time I took a photo of it or just the hole itself, it would just come out black. I didn't realize how long I had stayed at the barn investigating until it hit me that I needed my flashlight to see clearly. I had done the dumb thing and ignored the gut feeling to leave because I had fooled myself into thinking I was safe due to the dry weather. I was wrong.The silence broke, and it wasn't because of me. It was just a simple shift of rotted barn wood. Then a creak. Then another. The then clearly audible footsteps, slow and dragging against the damp wood. The thing is, I couldn't tell where it was coming from. It was obviously from inside, but it was as if the sounds were coming from all directions. Then the laughing came. You know how cheesy it sounds when villains laugh in a movie, and the main character seems afraid even though it shouldn't be scary? Well, I understand it now. When you see it from their perspective, it is chilling. I shined my light all around, but the barn was empty. No movement anywhere, but the noises continues. The laughing began to increase in volume, and the steps became faster. Oh god I shouldn't have come back. I shouldn't have egged this on. What the fuck was I thinking?? I had to get out of there. I ran, my feet crunching against the gravel that made my feet feel like I was stepping on knives. I ran so hard that my throat dried until it felt like I had just swallowed sand paper. My pulse beat so hard in my head and neck that it hurt, and I nearly slammed right into my car door from not being able to open it fast enough. I could hear that creature chasing after me with heavy footsteps against the ground. I didn't hesitate to get inside my car. The clang from my door shutting echoed through country. I was shaking violently as I put my key in the ignition and drove away, pushing 90mph on a back country road. Then I saw it. It stood right in the middle of the road, its laugh still ringing in my ears. I closed my eyes for a moment and didn't swerve. I wanted to hit it. I wanted to know that it would end the madness and clean up the mess I made, but I never felt the impact. I never collided with that monster. It just seemed to disappear completely as if it completely evaporated out of thin air, but I had a proper visual today. Its silhouette may have looked human-ish, but this thing was anything but that. It was tall and gangly, not like slenderman or whatever, but extremely bony and frail looking as if it had never eaten more than a bread crumb all its life. It's fingers were long and ended with razor sharp nails that curled in from their length. And its face... Oh god its face. Gaunt and long and.. sinister. It smiled like it was a cat, and I was the mouse cowering in the corner. The look in its eyes.. I've never seen something so evil before, and I don't think I ever will. I didn't go home. I have a really bad feeling about being alone, and my best friend, let's call him _PERSON_, doesn't get off work for another two hours. I need to tell him. I need his help, or at least just a place to stay because there was no way I was going to spend the night alone. I knew in my gut that that was a bad idea. So here I am now, typing this at a Mcdonalds in my town, surrounded by strangers. My phone and laptop are dying though, so I need to get ahold of _PERSON_ soon. I'm scared reddit. I don't know what I'm dealing with. I don't know how strong this thing is. I can't go back to that barn though, but I think it's too late to reverse things at this point. I need your guys' help. Please, I don't know what to do. I'm in serious trouble, and I want out. My hands are shaking so hard that typing this is growing exceedingly difficult. It started to rain again..[Part 1](_URL_ 3](_URL_"
2k5z2i,45551,nosleep,1414122258,I stumbled across something strange in my old town. [Update 2],"Hello again, Nosleep. Sorry I haven't been updating regularly.. It's been a crazy week. I don't think I've gotten more than 6 hours of sleep since Monday. I keep having these awful dreams where I'm running down this weird tunnel underground frantically(although I never see anything chasing me) and that awful laugh just plays in my ears on repeat for what feels like hours. I ended up staying at _PERSON_'s, and I've been here ever since. He knows everything that's happened so far, and while he's fairly skeptical, he's willing to help me fix this mess. I haven't gone back to my house since my last trip to the barn. Instead, I've taken up the advice from you guys and learned the history on the land here, starting with the nearest neighbor. I won't lie, I was terrified to ask about the property because it's posted with several ""no trespassing"" signs. The man that answered the door was raggedy and had to be at least in his 80s, and boy did he look displeased to find two college kids knocking on his door. When we asked who owned the barn, he looked even more upset over our presence, and told us that we had no business going into that barn. It took a lot of persuading to get him to give us some information. Apparently a few decades ago, the bodies of 3 teenage girls were found under the floorboards of the barn completely mangled and barely resembled humans anymore. They were all blonde haired, green eyed girls about 5 feet tall, ages 18, 20, 22. The owner was charged with the murder, but before they could make the official arrest, he vanished. They never caught him after this, and eventually the case was forgotten. The barn is now just city property that will more than likely be condemned someday. The thing about the murders is that it wasn't just your average creepy guy going after younger girls story. Apparently, there was all kinds of satanic writings and symbols both on and around the bodies. I bet that if I went under the floorboards, there would still be some evidence of that actually, but I'm not sure that that's a good idea just yet. The old man said that he used to know the original owner of the barn, and there was always something off about him. That's all he would tell us before kicking us off his porch, slamming the door in our face after warning us to stay off his property and away from ""that damn barn."" I don't know if I can do that though.So there's some of the history anyway, but I want to know more. I'm not an avid believer in the paranormal, but this whole situation...This thing isn't human. It's getting inside my head, and if it were human, I would have hit it with my car. So, obviously if the owner was performing some kind of ritual, the girls were sacrifices. Now, there's just a few more questions I need answers to. Is it possible the owner is still alive? Or is this creature some demonic thing that the owner brought into this world? That would explain the getting in my head part, but what's the deal with the rain? Speaking of rain, It's been raining nearly every day now. It's almost never like this in my town, especially at this time of the year. It's unnerving, and everyone keeps bringing it up. I overhear people complaining about the shitty weather constantly in passing. Not only that, but just now on the news I just heard some information that I really really hope is just coincidence. An 18 year old girl was reported missing, last seen driving in her car on a country road 3 days ago... the same country road with the barn. She has blonde hair, green eyes, and is 5'2"". Is...is this because of me? Did I start this up again? God, I hope this missing girl has nothing to do with the creature from the barn..I know now that I have to go back and fix this mess. I'm still not entirely sure how I'm going to do this yet, but between you guys and _PERSON_, I think that there's gotta be a way. I know that blessing houses and areas generally works to banish evil...until that evil comes back stronger and more pissed off than ever,  but I might try just burning some sage. That's what you're supposed to do, right? God, I have no idea what I'm doing..I'm going to go back to researching the history some more and see if I can get some more information on the murders and the owner.. I'm tied up in this mess, and honestly one of the reasons I need to fix this is a rather selfish one. You see, I am exactly 5 feet tall with dark blonde hair, green eyes, and I'm 22. If this is a pattern, I'm the last to go.. I need to know who the next girl to go missing is going to be. I wonder if she's having the same nightmares as me, or if she's experiencing any of the anxiety and paranoia that I am. Hell, I don't even know if the 18 year old has anything to do with this still, but it can't hurt to assume she does.. or did. God, I hope she's okay, but realistically, I know better. If she's dead, it's my fault...[Part 1](_URL_ 2](_URL_"

I can't do anything. I just feel.. There's no word that can do justice to this pain. I can't eat or sleep or anything.

I'd love for my mood to be completely stable, but I can't see a therapist and psychiatrist when I'm starting a new 9 - 5pm job.

yftu4,51058,nosleep,1345317867,The House Behind the School,"This did happen to me years ago, but everything I write is true, I still don't know if this was real or imaginary, but it's been scarred into my brain forever.I live in a small town. Everyone knows everyone. Three elementary schools, one middle school, and one high school. Our school team name is the phantoms, which seems like a weird name for a sports team. It was allegedly named that because of a girl who commit suicide in the high school in our now defunct bell-tower. Her ghost supposedly ""haunts and lurks"" around the school and the street that the school is on. Right down the road (less than a half-mile) from the high school is the elementary school I went to. It's on the same street and all that jazz. Apparently, (from unreliable sources and giggling school kids) something bad happened in our elementary school as well, but it was never released to the press or anything. It varied from deaths, fires, and even people being buried in the back of the school. I never thought much of it (I still don't know really, now), I thought they were just tales told to scare kids, along with the story in the high school. Remembering personal things and experiences that happened in my childhood recently, I'm starting to think otherwise about my school's history.The first experience, rather experiences, I remember clearly were a ""game"" my friends and I played. Every time October rolled around during the year, we'd all sneak off during recess to the very back of the lot our school was on (it was a huge as hell field with several trees for hiding) and we thought we were so badass because we did it. (Yeah, so badass, right? -_-) I think it was probably first grade when we came across something we didn't know if we were supposed to see. Along the gates lining our school, were the backyards of peoples' houses. There was one that looked pretty unkempt and dirty. We got as close to the gate as we could, and our little eyes darted around the backyard, and we found some strange items you wouldn't normally find in a backyard. We found dozens and dozens of broken street signs, some almost completely covered in rust, but some looking brand new. it was weird, the pole and everything were still attached. As we kept on looking, we found little birdhouses dangling on branches, with strange symbols on them. Being that young, we thought they were just doodles or something, but now as I get older, I think they were similar looking to inverted crosses and other satanic symbols. We ran as fast as we could back to the classroom when the bell indicating recess was over rang. For the rest of that month, we sneaked back there everyday, and soon new things appeared. Some were just trash but there were more creepy drawings scattered around the backyard. We noticed about halfway through October a broken swingset that I didn't recollect seeing before, but who knows, maybe some branches were covering it or something. Oddly enough, after October ended, and this is the exact memory in my brain and it still creeps me out, could have been our juvenile minds playing tricks on us, but when we went back to check in early November, the house was literally gone. Like it was never even there, there were no signs of construction workers, thinking that it might have gotten knocked down, but it was just an empty space. The street signs and drawings were gone as well. We were freaked out, so for the rest of that year we stayed as far away from that area as possible. Call me crazy, but I feel like because we were lingering and poking at stuff, I feel like we unleashed something bad. Throughout the rest of my elementary school experience, paranormal events continued to pester me, as well as my other friends who had been looking at the house.We soon forgot about the house in second grade, but I believe my friend (I'll call him _PERSON_) thought it would be fun to look for the house again. We went when October began, and strangely enough, the house was back, like it never even left. I still remember anxiety overwhelm me when we saw it again.This did happen. Whether it was figments of our imagination, it did happen to us every year. Throughout October it would be back, but for the rest of the year it was gone.Let me know if you want to hear the actual paranormal experiences I had at the school. Thank you all for reading, I tried to word this the best as I could to make it not sound so monotonous."
yg52s,51058,nosleep,1345331314,The Girl in the Bathroom,"Continuation of [this](_URL_ the house disappearing, things slowly got worse. In the first few months of second grade our school was under major construction. They were creating a bigger lunchroom because our old one could barely fit one class in it, as well as an entire new wing to the school. It took them quite a while to finish it, and there was a period of time where the construction completely stopped due to ""mishaps"". This was when the stories began to fly. Kids whispered to each other about paranormal entities bothering the construction workers (In kid speak, ghosts) and eventually the rumors floated to me. Even at 8, I was skeptical, but I took it into mind. I was already creeped out about the house, so who knew what else could be happening?Our already small lunchroom became even more crowded because of the construction, so we pretty much had a makeshift lunchroom for six months. The rumors and stories about ghosts died down by the time it was finished, and everyone was excited to see it. The cafeteria was huge! With bright yellow walls and big, wall-sized windows filled the room. The cheery walls continued down to the new wing of the school. Everyone loved it. They made new, huge bathrooms that actually would work, unlike our old ones. It became habit for the kids to hang out in the bathroom and talk. Wanting not to be left out, I did it too. I really wasn't that much of a popular kid, so I'd kind of get shut down by the girls when I tried to join in their conversations. Eventually, I just stopped trying. One day though, I went back to the bathroom (For obvious reasons, lol) and it was completely empty. When there wasn't the chatter of other people in there it felt so eerie. It just seemed off. (Cliche, I know, but it did) I did my thing, then went to wash my hands. I was about to leave when I heard something along the lines of a young girl crying. Curious, I pushed open every stall to see if there actually was another person in here with me. There wasn't. I guess I assumed it was coming from outside the classroom, I turned to leave again, when suddenly all the stall doors flung open and shut. The crying grew louder. I nearly shit myself and ran as hard as I could out. By the time I got into the cafeteria I was in tears. The lunch ladies tried to comfort me but I was an incoherent, babbling mess. They sent me down to the nurse so I could lay down. The nurse asked me what happened, and I said there was something in the bathroom. Not thinking much of it, she sent me back, saying that there was nothing to be afraid of. When I came back into the lunchroom, of course all the kids were mocking me, so I felt like a complete idiot. I told the lunch ladies and they held my hand and took me down to the bathrooms again. It seemed like everything was normal when we went back in, and they said that it was just my imagination. I still don't know if it was actually something or not, but it felt real. All throughout second and third grade (I had the same teacher two years in a row, as well as the same classroom, which of course was right near the bathroom) things would always get moved in our classroom, and my things would just disappear. My teacher just said it was the janitors, but it felt like it happened way too often. The thing that creeped me out the most though was after I had calmed down about the girl in the bathroom, I went outside for recess. When I got out there, there were what I called ""the doodles"" spray-painted and carved into the trees. The same symbols I saw at the disappearing house. I called my friends over and we were scared shitless. We didn't say anything to the teachers, but I think they noticed the signs too, because they tried their best to conceal the carvings on the trees.I don't know if there were Satanic cults visiting our school at night, but now I feel like that seems reasonable. I have one more story that truly gives me chills down my back when I think about it. It happened a little after the girl in the bathroom. Let me know if you want to hear it! Thanks for reading."
yhpeb,51058,nosleep,1345414625,Molly,"Continuation of [this](_URL_ year after my experience with the girl in the bathroom, (I never saw/heard her again) I had pretty much forgotten about the incident. I was in third grade, and I don't know why, but that year everyone was big on telling scary stories to each other constantly. Some were just stupid, but one scared me. I'll give a quick summary of the story and i'm pretty sure some of you have heard it before. So here it goes:""One day, a little girl and her mother went to the toy store. Her mother said she could pick any toy she wanted, since it was her birthday. The little girl fell in love with this one doll, which seemed a bit strange. The doll only had two fingers on each hand, but they bought it anyway. The daughter named her _PERSON_. The cashier seemed a bit worried about them buying that doll, but he kept his mouth shut. As the mother and daughter walked out of the store, the cashier hurried from the cash register to warn them about the doll, but the manager sent the cashier back to work.The mother told the daughter that she was going to clean up around the house because family was going to come over to celebrate her birthday, so she sent the daughter up to her room so she wouldn't be bothersome. When the girl got upstairs, she felt a little mischievous, so she locked herself in her room with the doll. She sat down and began to play with it.The mother finished cleaning and she was a little worried that her daughter had been so quiet, so she went to check on her. She was surprised to find the door locked, so she knocked and told the daughter to open. _PERSON_. After banging on the door and continuously asking her daughter to open it, she knocked the door down, becoming her daughter may have been sick. She was confused when she entered the room.No one was in there. She thought she heard a giggle from underneath the bed, so maybe the daughter was pulling a prank on her. She peered underneath the bed and screamed. Her daughter was covered in blood, and one finger from each hand had been cut off. She quickly pulled her onto the floor, and began to sob when she saw multiple stab wounds on her child. Then, she glanced at the window, and jumped back. The doll she had just bought was climbing out the window, armed with a bloody knife, and smiled at her.""Four fingers left,"" She giggled and jumped out the window.The mother clutched her daughter and called 911.(Yes, I know the story sounds stupid now, but at 9 years old, I was terrified. I think the next part is more showing how the mind can truly play tricks on you and drive you mad.)That story stuck with me for some reason, since I lived with my _PERSON_, and slept in a room covered in her porcelain doll collection. After hearing that story, I'd be too afraid to sleep in my own bedroom and usually slept with my nanny (that's what I call my _PERSON_). I think my friends even picked up on my fear of that story, so they thought it was funny to tease me about it and try to scare me even more.Way past the disappearing house, there was a big mound of dirt in the very back of our school. My friends convinced me that _PERSON_ (the doll) was buried underneath there and she'd try to grab at you if you came too close. Of course, then they dared me to go there, and if I didn't I'd seem like a baby. I begged my friends to at least come with me, and they agreed to it.The day we decided to go during recess was an overcast, cold day. (If I remember correctly, it was somewhere around the beginning of March) They pretty much dragged me there, and I was on the verge of tears. Once we reached it, they pushed me onto the top of the mound and told me I had to stand there for one minute. I whined, but they stuck to it. Probably about 30 seconds in, my friend _PERSON_ screamed and pointed at me.""I see it shaking! _PERSON_, get off!"" _PERSON_ cried.I don't think I've run as hard as I did in my life. By that point I was sobbing, the wind stinging against my face. Once we reached back to the playground, everyone was going in. I became completely red when my friends began to laugh at me. ""Wow, we sure got you!"" My friend _PERSON_ said.I noticed everyone else was laughing except for _PERSON_. I saw fear in her eyes and she was still staring back at the mound. I was still crying, but she whispered in my ear, ""I wasn't joking around. I saw her, I saw _PERSON_."" My blood went cold. I cried even harder. I was grateful we were back inside, but I remember a girl had forgotten her jacket outside, and the lunch ladies allowed her to get it. _PERSON_ and I panicked. We thought _PERSON_ would get her. We were waiting in a line for our teachers to come bring us back to our classrooms, and I remember looking out the window in the door and seeing something that still sends chills down my spine to this day. A doll hand.That's when I lost it. I began screaming and sobbing hysterically, and everyone stared at me. The lunch ladies brought me down to the nurse because I guess they thought I snapped or something. Through tears, I explained to the nurse what I saw. Since she didn't believe me about the girl in the bathroom, she didn't believe this either. She allowed me to lay down, though. I remember her walking over to me with a little doll in a nurse's uniform. She pretty much shoved it in my face and said, ""See? Dolls aren't scary. They're nice."" I don't remember much after that. But as I get older, it seems more and more likely that I was just letting my mind play tricks on me, but either way, I have that picture of the doll's hand instilled into my brain. I guess I've gotten into paranormal stuff lately (which is how I discovered nosleep), and I heard that since dolls are hollow, they are a a source of where spirits can be kept. I saw it on some show. I don't know what exactly happened that day, but all I can say is that I've never felt that much fear since.Thanks for reading my strange stories about a lonely child with a wild imagination."

I was out of school from December '13 til the end of the school year. I got better enough to go into my junior year of HS, and was actually feeling okay, but lo and behold, I crashed again. This past Christmas I became depressed again, and too depressed to go into school, so now I'm being home tutored again.The problem is now that I'm so anxious I can't even pick up a pen to write or do homework, and I began to get suicidal ideations about two weeks ago. I had an emergency session with my therapist, and decided that my home tutoring needed to be suspended temporarily. I'm not actively suicidal (honestly I'm afraid of death and blood and all those things) but I can't take this anymore. My mind is constantly being bombarded with thoughts that I'm a failure, my feelings are not real, I'm overexaggerating everything, and that I'm just an all around sad excuse of a human being. The thoughts are so often that I'm tired of trying to combat them, and I just let them fly.I'm on medication and have been since I was 12, but it just feels like nothing is working. I'm tired of temporarily feeling okay and then just becoming depressed again.It's hard seeing my friends get by just fine in school while I cry over not being able to write a sentence of homework.

Second, I understand I have very little knowledge of what an engineering degree requires and that some of my post might be wrong. Correct me if you must. :)Anyway! I'm currently going into my third year of university, double majoring in Ecology and Japanese. Although nature and ecology both fascinate me, I have not enjoyed the classes and no longer think it is the right fit for me. Therefore, I plan on changing my Ecology major to Civil Engineering before the fall semester begins - I came up with engineering because I have always liked math and I'm very logically oriented - I love solving problems/puzzles/etc. I had a bad experience with a physics professor, but always found it very interesting. Now, I have this self-defeatist attitude about engineering - partly because I'm not the type to tinker around with circuit boards or create fabulous miniature robots in my spare time (this is my stereotype of the perfect engineer, correct me if I'm wrong) and I've heard how difficult it can be for a woman in the field (again, stereotype I've seen). My interests are very broad and I have no guidance as of yet for my major change (other than my parents, whom I love dearly but neither graduated high school so I'm somewhat on my own here as far as coursework, the industry, and other more technical topics). I have a very vague idea of what I want to do, but I'd love to get involved with the 'green' energy movement and work in environmental engineering or biological engineering (possibly, I'm open to any ideas). Any comments/suggestions/opinions? I'm a quirky girl with a love of renewable energy and a desire to travel. Help?"

I switched high schools between 9th and 10th grade because I hated it so much. My grades were good, but I admit I didn't really have to work for them. I was always told by the very few friends I had (read: usually my boyfriend at the time) that it got better after high school. I held on to that for the longest time. Fast forward, I'm in my 3rd year of college. I feel guiltier and more terrible than ever because I still have no friends and I feel like it's my fault. I have a boyfriend, one of the most supportive boyfriends I've ever had, but it's not fair for him to handle the burden that is my problems. To compare:High school - ate lunch in the bathroom stallCollege - eat lunch to-go in a corner of the library, in my apartment or not at allHigh school - Spent weekends at home sleeping to escape the hatred for myselfCollege - Spend weekends and anytime I'm not in a mandatory class at home sleeping or in the library hiding, on reddit or playing video gamesHigh school - was involved, knew how to fake a smileCollege - possibly regressed, can't even fake happiness anymore I feel like I'm just getting worse. I'm only 20 and I feel like I'm getting an ulcer and (LADIES ONLY; MEN SKIP DOWN) have bizarre cycles. I went without 'one' for a month and now I've been on 'one' for almost a month without a break. I literally cry every single day and have a breakdown every 2-4 days. Freshman year I would hang out on the top floor of the parking garage when I was depressed and lay out various medications about twice a semester, getting ready to end it. I haven't done that lately (only because I made a promise to the boyfriend, who has a small idea of how bad it really is) but I want to more than ever, almost daily, which he nor anyone else knows. I know I should go get help, but I'm having a terrible time getting over the stigma. :/ I'm still clinging to the hope that it just 'gets better'. I don't know what to do. I know the obvious is 'get help', but is there anything else I can do? I can provide more details if someone needs them.I know this is long, and I made it shorter once already, but this past week even getting out of bed or typing out a story like this drains me. Sorry about the length. :/"
ly7cn,47221,Thetruthishere,1320271640,[FAM] [THY] I feel like I may have some terrible memory block from childhood based on an encounter.,"This may be really unfocused, but I'll try my best to organize all the info. This is long and I apologize!Family Member _PERSON_:  Backstory first. I was born in Northern Maine, a fairly creepy place in itself. My dad was stationed at the Air Force base, where he met my mom (also born there). The base closed down about a year after we moved back to my dad's home state (not disclosed, but central east US area). The town my mother's family is from is a historic swedish colony (I am related to a fair amount of the population up there) and many of our family members know Swedish.   That aside, the story: My great grandmother (still alive) lived in an old house surrounded on three sides by evergreen forests (bears, moose, the works up there). It is a historic house and three generations before my grandmother lived there (the first resident was the son of one of the colonists; one of the first children born at the colony). My mother's family has always believed that the house is haunted by an old woman in white, although we aren't sure who she is - very few women have lived in the house (they are all family anyway) and we have no family record of a woman fitting her description. My parents lived with my great grandmother for a short time after having me and before moving away. My mother was alone with me in the house; my great grandmother and father were both away working/volunteering. She was downstairs and heard me laughing on the baby monitor upstairs in their room (it was naptime). She thought it was odd but brushed it off. About 15 minutes later I was still giggling, so she decided to come see what was going on. As she reached the bottom of the stairs, she heard a woman talking to me, in some language she didn't understand (she knows Swedish, so it wasn't that). Of course, she was terrified, but she froze. The woman talked a little longer and then stopped. She walked out of the room into the hallway, saw my mother, and walked into the door across the hall from my room. My mom ran upstairs to corner her, but nobody was there. She checked on me and I seemed fine.   My mother, obviously, told me the story, when I was 7 or 8 years old. I thought it was interesting and wanted to know more. But whenever I brought it up to family as a kid, especially if we were in the house, they have always gotten upset and changed the subject. My _PERSON_s:  We visit for 3 weeks every summer, and I have (every year) constantly felt watched in that house. Since we don't talk about it for some reason, I asked my sister if she felt that way, and she didn't. It rarely feels 'negative' or 'evil' but it makes me uneasy. It certainly doesn't feel 'positive'. Imagine someone taking a great interest in you, but not wishing harm on you. I just feel like someone is watching my every move. Present Day:   From the little bit I have found out, we left very suddenly from Maine. They never explained why, they always just said ""we wanted to be back here"" even though my mother had just given birth when we traveled here and the trip wasn't easy on her. For as long as I can remember (I'm 20) I have really pronounced memory blocks of my summers. It is extremely difficult to remember anything but tiny snippets of my childhood summers in Maine (even as recent as age 15) and I have always had a terrible memory of anything even slightly difficult (one of the only memories of me getting anxious as a kid was in the house in Maine, when I was, for no reason, getting really tight chested and short of breath - it was the middle of the night and my sister and I were sleeping in the same room my crib was in as a baby).The only reason this is odd is because I have debilitating anxiety and I find it hard to believe that it appeared out of nowhere. I can't remember names of teachers from even three years ago, and my 2nd, 4th and 9th grade years are a blur - I can't remember them, aside from a tiny snippet here and there. It turns out I was a _PERSON_ from 2nd-7th grade, and I didn't even remember at all. I had found my old vest and asked my mom about it; I had accumulated a lot of badges, so it wasn't a passing thing. I attended a church for 6 years and didn't remember where it was located (a few blocks from my house).  Opinions? I'm wondering if there's a possibility that something happened to cause these bad mental blocks. I know a sensible thing to do would be ask my parents, but these are the same parents who hid from me I had _PERSON_'s until I was 20. :I I can't really cover everything that's ever happened, but I feel like this could be paranormal, not just mental illness (if you think it is mental, give theories also). So, yeah. Aside from that, any suggestions/theories are welcomed! If you can't tell, I can't keep thoughts straight, even with lists.EDIT: Debunk if you want! I want any feedback at all! :)"

m1l4d,47221,relationships,1320517383,My boyfriend doesn't shower regularly?,"We've been dating about 7 months; he's 21 and I'm 20. He refuses to shower regularly. I love him dearly but lately that has gotten worse. I came back from work (I work Saturday mornings at a bakery) and he smelled - it was pretty bad. He was wearing the same shirt he wore yesterday and admitted to not showering since Thursday night (but saw no problem with that). He then stuck his dirty slippers on my head - my hair smells now. Even though he doesn't like to shower daily, I tried to explain he needs to at least wash up and wash his face once a day - we both have _PERSON_'s and take a no-nonsense, honest approach to talking to each other. That aside, he also doesn't brush his teeth; he only uses mouthwash - this alone is disgusting to me. He lives very dirtily - his friend and I constantly try to help him keep his dorm room clean. He only showers when he is to the point of offensive odor, and I find him attractive but cannot be around him when he is like this. Even worse, we had sex Thursday after he showered and he hasn't washed since then. How can I help him with this? It's gotten to the point that I can't take it anymore. EDIT: I talked to him about it again. I was blunt and told him that going a day without a shower is okay sometimes, but he is a big guy and needs to shower daily because he gets sweaty. I told him that even though he may not be able to smell it, others can and it's not pleasant. I didn't deny him sex, but I told him how unpleasant it was for me when he wasn't clean. He bought a toothbrush and some toothpaste last night, and he showered as soon as we finished talking. We'll see how things go. Thanks Reddit!"

poejm,47221,depression,1329184523,I just hate myself.,"I'm sorry if the title seems attention-needy, or pathetic, but it sums me up right now. I'm a college student with no friends (yes, I do have people who talk to me, but it's not the same). I haven't actually been invited by anyone to do anything not study- or extracurricular-related for over a year (and I know hundreds of people on campus; not an exaggeration between everything i'm involved in). I am painfully shy outside of business type situations (meetings, classes) but trying to change that (I started Wellbutrin last month, so I got a little hopeful). I am attempting to pledge for a service fraternity, as it is something I had always wanted to do but never had the courage to. A week in, and not only was I the only pledge they 'forgot' to invite to parties, bowling, going out to eat, etc., but my 'big' hasn't even talked to me outside of the initiation ceremony day. She has my number, but I don't have hers. Tonight at the pledge meeting (5 pledges), I noticed that the two pairs were already good friends, and most people knew each other (inside jokes and such). I feel cheated. I desperately want to make friends (it's slowly killing me and making me bitter without them) and I already feel like they have no desire to even get to know me. I wanted a hug afterwards from my boyfriend (who, to be honest, is wonderful but a touch emotionally abusive, and gets angry and defensive and has a short fuse whenever I try to bring it up - I try very hard to not make it a codependent relationship, but he pushes me to hang out with him when I get depressed, I feel like a burden because he actually has friends), but he was in the middle of a tutoring session, so I waited in the campus store outside and ate dinner and studied. He came out for a minute and told me to come with him to sign me into his dorm. When I explained that I was fine, I was going to stay and get dinner, he got angry, said 'fine', and walked out. Even as he waited to get back into the dorm, me looking at him on the verge of tears, he wouldn't even look at me. Reddit, can I please talk to someone here? There's obviously something that I do, say, or give off that people despise me for. I do nothing but try to be a hard working person. I cared so much about the few people in my life i'd been close to, and in the end I keep getting used, ignored, or hurt in the end. I'm 'okay' now, so this isn't for /r/suicidewatch, but I rode my bike over and saw the parking garage, imagining plummeting off of it, imagining veering my bike into the 4-lane avenue next to me. Even now, I'm in a computer lab on the 5th floor of a building with a window open and I measured whether I could fit through it. I only after starting this post realized how unhealthy that was.Reddit, I need help. I've tried counseling before and they just try to tell me that I need to lose weight (no, seriously) or try to prod me about family to find some deep-seated emotional issue. There isn't any. I grew up in a loving home with supportive parents who had a good relationship. I had friends as a kid. I don't know what happened, but it's slowly turning me into a very hateful, bitter person (i get resentful when i see happy groups of friends lately). I don't want to become this, but I try and fail so many times (for the sake of not making this an even bigger wall of text, I won't go into it unless someone asks). Any advice at all, Reddit? Even if you just want to call me a stupid, needy, cowardly bitch, I understand. I just want to know what I do that makes me so despicable."

I'm down to 225, but it took me over 6 months to get motivated. Pictures, inspirational stories, rewards, nothing worked for me. I was so discouraged because I calculated the amount of weight I could reasonably lose in a 2 week period. With my exercise, I got back 7.5 pounds. I was upset because that seemed like nothing when I had 90 pounds to lose. What finally motivated me was **think of weight loss in percentage of body mass lost**. That 7.5 pounds was measly in my eyes, but ~3% of my total weight in just two weeks made it more tangible, something I wanted to strive for.**TL;DR** - I was never motivated to lose weight realizing I could only healthily lose X pounds a week. Started thinking of it in % body weight lost and it motivated me (7.5 pounds versus a whole 3% of my body weight). Which sounds better to you?"

Although it's better to concentrate on the food itself, I have a hard time sitting still and this reading helps me to focus on the food and not grab for a remote.This motivates me to eat well, or discourages me from eating poorly, all while building my food/nutrition knowledge. Over the past 3 months, I've learned the primary vitamins/minerals of many a fruit and vegetable, as well as some unhealthy foods (I didn't even want to finish my hostess cupcake when i read the ingredients). Sorry if this isn't the place, but this has made the difference for me, as I wake up and think about how mushrooms are packed with B-vitamins and minerals versus poptarts that have more fat per package than a serving of ice cream. I choose the mushroom omelet more often now.**TL;DR** I learn fun (IMO) facts about the foods I'm eating while eating - intimately knowing the composition of my foods helps me to choose healthier and be more mindful of what's going in my body."
xuoli,47221,AskReddit,1344383907,"_PERSON_, what is life really like after college?","My question comes from a very unstable family growing up. I'm currently in college double majoring in engineering and ecology, so my boyfriend tells me that life after college will be fun, and that it won't be a soul-crushing existence. However, I come from a low-income family with a myriad of problems (both health-related and otherwise). Bipolar disorder, thyroid/hormone problems, dysthymia, diabetes, heart disease - these all run in my family, and despite being a pretty positive person, I have always dealt with people being negative. Mom hasn't worked since I was born, and does nothing but sit inside all day and watch TV. Dad works 45-50 hours a week and then has talked to me since I was 11 or 12 about how soul crushing being an adult and parent is. I've grown up with this mentality, and can't really fully enjoy anything. Again, unhealthy. Before it's asked, I'm on antidepressants and currently not diagnosed with any of the above family health problems but depression.This has all been on my mind lately because I graduate in two years. I'd like to hear what ""adulthood"" (after college) is like from people who aren't my parents, preferably truthful posts (I don't expect a unicorn rainbow story).

I'm not feeling great and can't write very well so my explanation won't be very exciting. :(I'm a college student, engineering major, taking 18 hours this semester. I'm workinng as well, as a notetaker. I have severe depression and have recently ""discovered"" that my mother (and her mother, and her mother's mother) all have narcissistic personality disorder - a cause of great stress as a kid for me, since I had some huge issues from abuse resulting from it, but therapists wouldn't believe me as a kid and side with the mother. This would be plenty to stress me out.However, I've been sleeping on a loveseat and living out of a suitcase for 1.5 months now. Why? My apartment.My apartment, which was rented to me from a respected and well-known leasing office in the area, is uninhabitable. Since last August when I moved in, the toilet didn't work the first week I was there, then the a/c stopped working (still August), my leg went through the balcony, in turn causing me to drop my laptop and destroy the hard drive (still sitting in my apartment because I can't afford to get it fixed), the fridge stopped working and all my food spoiled because they didn't come fix it for 4 days (this is around September), I had a raccoon problem on my balcony (when they caught him, apparently it had rabies), in October I started getting mice in the apartment, asked them to take care of the issue, they went for MONTHS without doing anything at all, despite my best efforts the problem got worse, it got to the point that I found a huge pile of droppings right before finals started last semester. During finals week itself it rained to the point that we had a huge leak in our roof (we are an attic apartment) and they did nothing but give us a tarp (which is still sitting in the apartment, they never came to get it).Pause, breathe, I'll continue with this semester.This semester, before classes even started, my roommate called me at 6AM screaming. Another raccoon had actually gotten into our utility closet. Luckily, they sent someone the same day to catch him. I had asked them to repair the roof and hire an exterminator in December to no avail. The mouse problem was so bad that we put out a brick of poison and it was completely gone within a week. Since I have a huge phobia of bugs, mice, etc, I've been staying at my friend's apartment, sleeping on her loveseat, living out of a suitcase since I've gotten back to school this semester. They finally hired a pest control person (no national companies though, that'd be too expensive), who did nothing but put a few traps out. I've been withholding rent since January.I've missed a ton of class so far this semester just from stress, and I'm frustrated because I've messed up in the past from depression-related problems (I had legitimate mental breakdowns twice last semester alone, and have gone through manic episodes, completely lost my mind for hours at a time, and am generally unstable).It doesn't help that the aforementioned mother (and family) don't really care. I don't get financial or emotional support from them in any way, and don't know what to do with myself. My boyfriend cares, but he has his own issuse and his patience with mine are wearing thin.Reddit, I honestly don't know what to do. I don't want to break my lease because I want to keep my credit rating (a solid B)."

They have since moved them back to between the houses, and even removed one of the trash cans..I'd love to be able to get someone to inspect the apartment and deem it unlivable, because the kicker is they don't have time to fix all these issues, but they have time to show my apartment to be leased next year..I'm in WV. I appreciate any ""advice"" (I know, not legal advice). I need to know what I should do about this, whether I have a case to end my lease without hurting my credit score, and whether I am within my right/ if it is a good idea to be withholding rent."

346kns,47221,xxfitness,1430245861,My take on the #effyourbeautystandards movement.,"Hi guys. I'm not the healthiest person, but I need to say a few words on the “body positive” movement. I was always a big kid - not fat, but tall. Fat came later - I was an awkward kid who liked to turn to food for comfort starting in middle school. I’ve weighed over 200 since the age of 12-13. I was teased some for my weight, my height, and my chest, which developed early. Even now, I’m 5′9″ and almost 300lbs. I am without a doubt a big, big girl.Does this mean I should eff the beauty standards? Perhaps. I don’t dwell on my body most of the time. Does this mean I should argue I am healthy? Absolutely not.I can love myself for what I am right now - a work in progress. However, I would be deluding and hurting myself in the long run to argue that I am healthy. Do I think big is beautiful? Sure, it definitely can be. Bodies are a work of art, and they’re fascinating. Do I think all people should love their bodies, for the good and the bad, through better or worse? Definitely. Do I think fat bodies are healthy bodies? No fucking way.I understand that larger women have been isolated for a long time from society due to societal beauty standards. I really do, and I’ve experienced it first hand. However.I cannot argue that it is entirely society’s fault. Yes, society beauty standards are unattainable in a lot of ways due to Photoshop and they are damaging to younger girls. For that, I love the body positive movement. Girls should strive for healthy, not starving. However, they shouldn’t be deluded into thinking that excessive fat is healthy either. It’s just not. There’s no way to argue it.Do you know what’s body positive to me? Taking care of my body. All bodies are a work in progress, and the vast majority of fat people can better themselves. Stop hiding under a guise of “fat is healthy” or “I can’t lose weight”. Unless you’re in the 2% of fat people who truly can’t lose weight, stop making excuses. Is this the kind of example we want to give to the next generation? Create a movement to hide behind because accountability and self-discipline is hard? I have been on a diet for a month. I didn’t eat too badly before, truly - I just ate a lot of it. Fat is fat, whether it comes from french fries or almonds and walnuts. I’ve lost 15 pounds and I’ve never been happier with myself - I feel better physically. I feel more confident in myself - not because I wasn’t pretty before, but because I am showing myself that I have the discipline and accountability to track my food and watch my portions. I do very light yoga in the morning. Over time, I hope to lose more weight, exercise more often, and feel better to weight lift, hike, rock climb, and all of the other activities that are harder due to my weight now.Take your body back. Lose weight until you actually feel good - until you’re not at risk for dying before 50. Show little girls that anything is possible, and that everyone is a work in progress who should love themselves at any size, but have the knowledge and introspection to realize what is healthy and what is not. *That* is body positivity.Thanks for letting me rant, everyone. &lt;3"
3hxn11,47221,keto,1440216682,"I'm starting keto again Monday, no excuses.","I was on keto for months earlier this year and I felt amazing. No more puffy, water retention arms. No more headaches. No more severe fatigue after 3PM. I quit because I got lazy with keto. I started upping my carb counts, then I ""treated"" myself to one small thing and started craving carbs again, then I ""treated"" myself to bigger things. Once I realized I was off keto, I told myself ""I can go right back on whenever I want"" because I had a better relationship with carbs. _PERSON_, no I didn't.I mistook being able to keto as being ""cured"" of carb cravings, but they're just as bad as before keto. I'm starting keto again Monday (so I can grocery shop, food prep) because I'm sick of feeling like crap again. I was able to keep losing weight off keto, but it's just not the same. I don't *feel* good, even if I am seeing results. So, keto it is. Wish me luck!"

alveg,41458,reddit.com,1262713547,"Good afternoon Reddit, I just woke up and I need you to analyse a dream for me!","So I've noticed that whenever I'm sick, (right now I have strep), I tend to have very profound or vivid dreams for some reason. The one I had last night was very strange, and I haven't had a dream like this one in a while. So, here goes!First things first, the dream takes place in the late summer. One of those dusty, dry summers that you would see out west in Oklahoma or something like that. The dream started with me standing in my driveway, but instead of what is usually there, to the west there is a large field that had recently been planted with cabbage or some other kind of vegetable. In the middle of the field, standing between the rows of seedlings was a short hardened-looking chinese man, dressed in a Gee (martial-arts garb). I run up to him, with my girlfriend who has just appeared, and he begins to 'train' us by making me run around the field with my girlfriend on my shoulders. After about an hour of this, I run inside my house to grab something and I hear music coming from outside. I rush outside and see that it is coming from some kind of wooden shack next to the field. I run to it, and open it and inside there is an AC/DC tribute band (I don't like AC/DC by the way), playing  an AC/DC-sounding song. Theres a shitload of people outside the shack that immediately start trying to push their way in when I stand on the threshold of the shack. I am able to get inside, and push myself to the front of the crowd. I see three people up there, one is _PERSON_ ghost, another is an old man sitting on a chair, and the last is a younger man with pale skin and greasy hair. He grabs me by the arm and places what looks like paper on my right forearm. The paper dissapears into my skin and I run out of the shack, pissed off.       I come outside to see my girlfriend carrying a sack of cabbage and the crowd of people that was inside the shack being trained by the Chinese man. I walk down to my girlfriend, and I tell her that I'm tired of training and she agrees. We walk down to the lower part of the field and there is a barn down there. We walk inside the barn, and immediately I am gagged by a garrote, held by no one. My girlfriend runs, and we don't see her for the rest of the dream. I am able to pull myself out of the choke hold and run further inside the barn. A few more weird things happen, and I realize that the paper that was placed on my arm is a curse and I am being haunted by a ghost. After being tormented by the ghost for a while, the scene changes to another house in the middle of nowhere. I instantly know that the ghost is inside that house, and I walk inside. I have a knife with me and threaten the person that comes to the door to let me in. He says, ""Oh,  you're here for her"" and lets me through without trouble. The inside of the house is dark, and I start searching for the ghost. I see the ghosts 'brothers' who are both maybe around 17 or 18 look at me, and then go back to whatever they're doing. I find the ghosts room, and the ghost has taken the appearance of the girl from silent hill (the unburned one). I begin yelling and throwing things, asking why I am cursed, and i grab her by the throat and look at her face. It is covered in hair, and she smiles sinisterly at me. At this point the father and the two brothers come into the room, and explain to me that she is mute, and the girl agrees to stop haunting me. A 'scoreboard' pops up, and the ghost is given a rating of 383 out of 500 for haunting me."

dgdy5,41458,SelfSufficiency,1284995967,I am attempting to build a greenhouse and I could use some expert advice.,"Hello everyone, I own an 8 acre farm in southeaster Pennsylvania and recently I have become very interested in the topic of self sufficiency. Part of my plan involves building a greenhouse. Luckily, there are a variety of buildings on my farm that can be used for my projects. Infront of my barn is a foundation of what used to be a chicken coop or pig sty or something to that nature. It is roughly 40 feet long and 16 feet wide, but I will only be using a 22' 8"" x 16' 8"" section to build my prototype greenhouse, with plans to extend it to the rest of the foundation at a later point in time. The foundation is quite old, maybe somewhere around 70 to 80 years, and the concrete is not in optimum condition, but I don't have an extremely disposable income and putting a greenhouse on this foundation would be most cost effective for me, as well as convenient. The foundation is south-facing and receives light from 7am all the way until dusk. Here are some photos of it:_URL_ you can see I still have a lot of clearing and cutting to do, the base has been overrun for about 10 years since the building on top of it was torn down due to structural insecurity. Basically all I am looking for is advice. Looking online at greenhouse supply stores is mind-boggling and I don't know where to start. Is there anyone out there that could give me some help on starting this project? I'd be looking for information along the lines of what website to buy my materials off of, what materials I should use (longevity being the most important factor to me), and general information about building a greenhouse. I have done some research into the topic, but overall I am still a novice. Southeastern PA usually has mild winters, so I was planning on using a thermal mass heater for my greenhouse that I could use for the colder winter nights, and possibly rain barrels for water collection. I do, however, have a water line that conveniently already runs to the base of this structure. Thanks for your help!"

dqgo4,41458,SuicideWatch,1286934234,As soon as I can buy a gun...,"I've backed myself into a corner, and as a constantly frustrated person I can't expect more out of myself but that acceptance doesn't stop me from hating myself. Nothing stops me from hating myself. Even though I realize that there are millions of people dying of hunger right now, it just doesn't stop me from hating my existence.I tried college, and I stopped going because I hated it. I hold a shitty job that pays nothing, working for people that couldn't give a shit if I died tomorrow. Every day I waste my time in this place, and every day I wish I would get hit by a truck on the way home. It's a pointless endeavor. I would try to find a new hobby but everything I try bores the living shit out of me or is costs money, and when you don't have any it's hard to find something to do. I don't have any friends I actually appreciate. I don't appreciate them because they are in the same position I am in, and being a working-class drone isn't a respectable position in my mind. Women drive me crazy. I thought I was in a picture perfect relationship that shit everywhere because it turned out that I lied to myself and made myself believed I loved a girl I didn't, yet, I still think about her every day. You'd say I still love her, but I wouldn't be content if I was in a relationship with her again. I would belittle her and take advantage of her anyway. I do my best to avoid relationships now because they seem to just get in the way of me trying to dig myself out of this shitpit that is my life, but no matter how much I focus on trying to get out of debt, it's never fast enough. No one is reliable. No one is dependable. No one has any fucking money. No one is industrious as I am and no one wants me around anyway so whats the fucking point? I'm fairly sure I've never actually felt love. All I have been able to do is fool myself into thinking I was in love. I haven't been able to feel happy since I left high school, and I'm forgetful as hell. I ask a lot of questions and always end up getting laughed at for asking questions that are obvious to everyone else, yet they always as me to come fix their bullshit when it breaks!I'm not motivated to do much of anything, ever. I'm already tired of writing this. I can't focus on fucking anything. I think I literally have a 30 second attention span, and then I just get frustrated because things are taking too long. The only constant in my life is feeling like shit, day in and day out, and when I don't, it's because I've convinced myself that feeling depressed is for weak people that can't get their heads screwed on the right way, but I'm pretty sure I'm the one that can't get his head screwed on the right way. I squandered all the money I made in the last 4 years on stupid shit that didn't make me any money back, and I still knowingly do it every day. My self control with money is like a child in a toys-r-us with mommy's credit card.  I hate myself because I can't be everything, and it's turning out it's hard for me to be anything at all. I'm not comfortable being this person. If I die, I won't know the fucking difference anyway so really the only thing I have left to do is find a good way to do it and talk myself into pulling the trigger. tl;dr bitchity bitch bitch, I bitch about frivolous shit."

vwgsu,41458,leaves,1341190264,I need help quitting my addiction. (tomorrow is day 1),"I don't actually smoke very much, usually only about a bowl a day, but I have sufficiently become dependent on marijuana. If I don't smoke, I become very irritated and aggressive, and I do and say things that I later regret. I've quit for long periods of time before, twice I quit for 6 month stretches and once for almost a year. Unfortunately, I was only sober for these times because I was on probation from offenses involving marijuana! Needless to say, marijuana has been and continues to be a part of my life ever since I started smoking it daily 4 years ago. I have gone through many changes and learned from many experiences in these times, and lately I have come to believe that I now posses enough understanding to see that smoking marijuana is leading me away from my goals and dreams. Starting with the lesions of time that I have limited memory of, to the large sums of money I've spent on buying it, as well as paying for being caught in possession of it. It has taken away much of my willingness to be social and to build relationships with people. It has buried many of my negative emotions that will eventually resurface. It has painted me with a stigma that I neither want nor choose to represent. All in all, I do not regret my experiences with the drug, for it has not done all harm, and I am now much wiser due to learning from the effects it has had on my life, but I now know that it is time to change, and this time for good.I have a mood dependence on marijuana, where if I don't smoke at least once a day I become ridiculously gloomy. I need support while I wean myself off, and I plan to start tomorrow. I plan to take ONE hit Monday and Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, skipping Wednesday to see how bad my withdraw is going to be without it completely. I will try not to smoke on the weekends. Next week I will plan around how successful I am this week. Sorry for the long read, but I would really appreciate anyone that could support me this week and just talk to me, or leave comments, whatever. I just need to know that there is someone out there that will give out some understanding words to help me get through this.Thanks Leaves."

I tried Abilify,_PERSON_, _PERSON_, and _PERSON_ before we landed on _PERSON_ as the antipsychotic that actually works.  The others led to dangerous side effects.  This just makes me fat, tired, and generally disgusted with myself.Ain't bipolar disorder grand, folks? *grumble*UPDATE:  Shrink and I re-evaluated the situation today, given my weight has risen consistently, and decided to taper off _PERSON_ over a couple of weeks and switch to _PERSON_.  I'm concerned about an increase in manic symptoms, but he doesn't seem to think that will be a problem.  Here's hoping!"
2czrtg,28148,BipolarReddit,1407516523,Strength and pride,"When I was diagnosed, I was working in a fairly high profile position serving students with learning disabilities at a university.  I had a million questions for my doctor and was terrified about what the diagnosis meant for my future.  One of my students was diagnosed at the incredibly early age of seven, so I broke protocol, called her in, and talked to her about her experience.  She told me something I'll never forget: she had learned to be proud of her disorder.This has been on my mind, and I thought I'd offer it as the slightest bit of hope.  We get through our lives and make big and small accomplishments in spite of the disorder.  Small wins are never really small-- they are accomplished in the face of what can truly be a monster.  Our disorder (regardless of type) does not define us, but it does prove our strength in many ways.  We can overcome some major stuff.  We prove that every day.(As an aside and to hopefully prevent being flamed, I'm not saying I love having bipolar disorder or that it is an easy road.  I had no choice in getting it, though, so I'm just trying to make the best of it and look at the positives.  Maybe someone else reading this needs to be reminded of how awesome they are.  Consider yourself reminded.)"

2egyng,28148,BipolarReddit,1408912962,Psychosis and overwhelm,"I feel like I'm taking up too much of this subreddit's space, for want of better words, these days because I keep posting so much.  Just going through an odd time right now.  There's an experience I can't quite explain in a way that my psychiatrist and therapist understand, so I'm wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience.Every time I get psychosis, everything around me seems magnified.  A negative word from my boss becomes an almost certain knowledge that I'll be fired, as well as the feeling that I am a horrible employee who never deserved the job in the first place.  That snowballs into missing work, as I'm certain that I'm going to be fired anyway at that point.  Any mention of a slight injustice in the world becomes a personal crisis.  Case in point- the last time this happened, I saw one of those television ads that shows animals who have experienced cruelty, and it was like I could feel exactly what the animal went through, emotionally and physically.  My mind couldn't stop focusing on increasingly cruel scenarios, and it was like I could see it all happening.  Basically, the slightest situation becomes magnified to the point that I get overwhelmed and shut down.  I end up working on very simple activities like molding dark-colored clay just to shut out any possible triggers and keep my mind from plunging me through every possible bad situation in the world as though it's happening to me or was caused by me.  Outside of those times, I can handle just about anything life throws at me.  When I'm having those psychotic times, though, every tiny thing becomes too stimulating, too overwhelming, and too horrible to even conceptualize.  Even happy things get overwhelming, as they make me feel guilty for having any sort of enjoyment when there are so many bad things happening in the world.  It makes me feel so crazy and out of control.  Does this hodge-podge sound familiar to anyone?  Sorry for the somewhat scattered wording.  I spent some time in that whirlwind recently and am going to try, yet again, to explain it to my therapist when I see her later this week."

2iw2dd,28148,BipolarReddit,1412974400,Unexpected effects,"I have a tendency to bottle emotion due to some nifty trauma in my background.  This results in all sorts of fun and is partially why I see a therapist regularly.  Earlier this week, we discussed grief from a loss I experienced almost 14 years ago.  I can state the facts of it and even list feelings that are internalized, but that's about all.  We're working on how to feel and release this stuff so I don't keep walking around it for another 14 years.  Naturally, we're discussing obstacles.  There is the aforementioned trauma and cultural stuff, but my therapist brought up bipolar disorder as another obstacle.  I hadn't considered this.  She explained that we often have to work on tempering my emotions during mood episodes, particularly when I'm manic.  We spend a great deal of time working on calming the irrational emotions of mood episodes and psychosis, so that makes tapping in to logical feelings a bit more difficult.  I'm still going down the rabbit hole of this loss, as it were, but apparently bipolar disorder is going to navigate this as well to some extent.  By no means do I feel defined by the disorder.  It just caught me off guard to think about how it affects seemingly unrelated issues.  I should have put it together--  strong emotions involved = potential bipolar problems-- but for some reason it just didn't click.  Should be interesting."

It's been months since I've felt completely stable.  On the outside, I have control of things.  I'm doing my job, paying my bills, and keeping friendships intact.  I appear perfectly happy and relaxed.  But I feel miserable.So how did I handle this inability to let others in on the way I'm feeling?  I managed to slice the length of my forearm from wrist to elbow.  I couldn't seem to speak the words ""I'm not OK,"" so I gave a visual representation.  And I deeply regret it.  I've dealt with SI on and off for years, and this is the first time a cut is visible with short sleeves on.  Most of my scars are easily covered.Anyone else experienced this feeling of having to appear stable at all times while absolutely falling apart on the inside?  I really want to get a handle on things and return to a more stable state, but things don't seem to be moving in that direction.  _PERSON_ doubled my dose of _PERSON_, and therapist helped me learn some meditation techniques.  I'm really trying to work this out.  Just wishing I could *speak* emotions, as opposed to carving them in my skin.Thanks for giving me a chance to get that off my chest, everyone.

Housemates are very abusive and sometimes dangerous, but I can't afford to move.  One broke my furniture, so I don't even have a room of my own anymore.  My best friend's house used to be my safe place, but his brother moved in and changed all of that.  His brother is a raging borderline and addict who brings chaos wherever he goes.

Now I'm living in this surreal didn't think I'd be here sort of time and trying to learn lessons.  One major thing I see is that I try to appear much more put together in front of my therapist than I actually am.  This is why no one expected the attempt-- I never let on to anyone that things were that bad.I know on a logical level that therapy is the place to drop all facades and let the craziness show, but something is stopping me.  It's like I need the therapist to think I'm ok so she'll be happy with the progress I've made.  And I have made some progress.  This rambling post is really a question-- have any of you had the problem of feeling the need to look put together in front of a therapist and/or psychiatrist even when you knew letting the real circumstances show was the best thing for your treatment?  I gave my word to two people in my family-of-choice that I would not kill myself, and I stand by my word.  The tough thing now is trying to diffuse everything that led up to the attempt in the first place, which I can't do if I feel compelled to appear put together at all times in front of the people who can help the most.Thanks, as always, for listening.

My brain seems to be stuck on trolling-the-depths depression with the added fun of delusions that last days and lead to very negative consequences.  Pdoc put me on _PERSON_, and we've titrated up to 120mg daily.  However, my depression seems to be getting *worse*.  _PERSON_, the drug specifically made for bipolar depression, is making my depression worse and not touching the psychosis or anxiety.  I'll give the new dose some time to work, but this isn't looking promising.We've tried abilify, geodon, seroquel, zyprexa, and risperdal.  The first two actually gave me life-threatening side effects (seizure and heart rhythm issues).  _PERSON_ made me sleep 12-14 hours at a time, and zyprexa wasn't much better.  _PERSON_ was fairly innocuous except the 50+ pound weight gain in a year.  _PERSON_ has kind of been my last hope.  Ironically, aside from a bit of stomach upset the first few days after a dosage increase, it has given me no side effects.  No idea where to go if this doesn't work.  Antipsychotics suck.EDIT (11 March):  Thanks to everyone who provided experiences/advice/information.  Taking the _PERSON_ with food really seems to be helping.  I've done that for the last few doses, and the psychosis is improving.  It's not gone completely, but it is definitely improving.

This is understandable, so I'm trying to make concessions.  He got *very* angry the last time I lit even a candle, citing the smoke as a trigger.  That's easy to overcome-- I just use LED candles painted in appropriate colors.  But what about the incense?  I'm at a loss.

I grew tired of this and started responding to all of these posts with arguments, citations and links.Later on, I realized that people who are decidedly Anti _PERSON_ were not going to change their views, but at least I could give the other perspective so that the people reading could have both sides of the story.I've noticed a LOT of Anti-_PERSON_ status updates etc. being shared by my friends (Most of them are from the Rock Music/Gaming community) but barely any support. Whoever supports him gets shunned quite quickly. For instance, the other day this guy shared Kejriwal's appeal and laughed at him for trying to spread lies.
