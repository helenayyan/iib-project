22941	get me out of here ive posted here before a few tomes so i hope you guys are not annoyed by me anyways it sounds weird but i do not really want to die that much i really wish i could live through all of my pain and have a good life and find happiness but with how things are for me now that seems impossible i feel so trapped and i am constantly thinking of ways out i do not like talking to people about my feelings irl because they will make fun of me for it especially my mom i do not want to call the suicide hotline because i am really really scared of calling people because of anxiety and im scared they will track me down or something and throw me in the mental hospital i am like 3 months clean from self harm and i do not really wan na go back down that road and there s no way i can wait another 4 + years because i have been waiting for most of my life so now i am deeply thinking about suicide again i say it on a bunch of different posts and its the same thing only it gets worse every day and i try to talk about it but people just keep saying to talk to therapists and just keep trying and stuff like that i did attempt suicide in march and it should have worked but unfortunately it did not but if i end up trying again then ill certainly make sure that it works but as i said i do not want to die i want to escape and suicide is the only way out so i really really want to know if there s anyone who knows how i can escape please help me and i actually want to escape not to just go to a therapist or get accommodations medicine something to do or just keep talking to people because that s what i have been fucking trying to do for a while and it has not been getting me anywhere whatever it may be that would help me i d need it to be pretty soon because i am far too tired of waiting if i have to wait a nother really long time then i might as well just go through with a new suicide plan overdosing i should have died i had the perfect plan i was going to commit suicide last friday i was going to sit in my room write the note overdose then fall asleep and never wake up but the day before that i talked to somebody on skype they somehow managed to talk me out of it she said that people would miss me and nothing good could come of it stuff like that it actually helped and i ended up not committing suicide i promised to her that i would not do it now i regret making that promise not an hour goes by where i do not think about how much i want to die i am starting to feel bad again i really should have gone through with the plan that friday i should be fucking dead right now i am still thinking about doing it but unlike before i am really conflicted it would allcaps finally allcaps get rid of all of the pain but that pain would just go on to the few people that care about me and i probably will not get to experience things that i love anymore but i am sort of starting to think that its worth it i can not deal with this pain anymore and i do not want to just live for other people i am seriously thinking about going through with suicide again i am tired and depressed and i just can not stand living in general i have certain conditions for it if i actually do go through with it there s no talking me out of that one i want to commit suicide but i cant i do not really know how to accurately describe how i feel in words i just want to talk and stuff ugh repeated everything is just so hard school is very hard for me for some reason and i am probably going to fail i really hate it everyone else seems to be so happy and i am just the quiet antisocial guy and no one really seems to care about me much there at home it is really hard because first of all there are a lot of arguments that go on that makes me sound weak but it actually affects me and also my mom likes to make fun of me she only seems to care about how i do in school everyone wants me to like and respect her but i have not felt any love or respect for her in years everyone thinks that that s bad but they do not know what it s like for me i overthink and i feel bad about everything i get anxious whenever i am close to being happy and i think about everything that s wrong and i just start to feel bad i can not help but worry about everything that happens i am so unmotivated i can not do any work or anything mostly when i am at home all i do is lay down in my bed and think and i do not do any work so it must be my fault because i do not really try i want to die too much i think i do have things i like i have some hobbies like writing and drawing but i have been too unmotivated to do either recently i do have a dream of what i want to do in the future i have some friends but maybe those things are becoming less and less effective the pain is just increasing i have decided that the only way out of this constant pain and depression is to die i wish i did not have to the few people that care would be destroyed and i will not be able to do all the stuff that i like or want to do so i can somewhat see a point in living but the thing is every time i get happy it always goes away i just want to be happy like everyone else repeated is that really too much to ask do i just deserve to feel bad like this that s what it s starting to feel like i am really tired of fighting i would cry but for some reason i can not cry anymore that feels really horrible to have to hold in my feelings like this i really want to just cry and let it all out i want to get help i want to talk to people but i am really antisocial and i can not talk to people and i hate myself for it and when i do try to talk to people they usually ignore me or forget about me this is all too much for me if things do not get better soon i am going to attempt suicide i just want it all to be over forever and nothing ever helps dying is the only way to make it better please convince me otherwise because i do not want to have to do this i knew this post would be confusing sorry for being such a burden you do not have to read all of this i just care that you listened even if you do not read it all or you can not help me with this thank you so much because you listened and cared and i think that s what i want somebody to understand and listen and help me i really need it dying would be so much better for so long i thought that i could actually get better but every time i feel better things just keep going downhill afterwards i do not even know how to accurately describe how i feel i always just slog through the school day thinking about how much i want to die then come home and be forced into something stupid its worse when im alone and my thoughts take over my mind that is something no one understands they all tell me that it gets better but i know my problems are pretty much inescapable as long if i am under 18 i have to be at home where all these arguments happen between my family members they think i do not hear it hurts more than they know all my free time is forced to be spent on useless shit work for fucking high school all of this high school bullshit controls my life i have things that i care about but i can not focus on them because of that all anyone seems to care about especially my mom is how well i do in school even after i turn 18 i would probably have all this financial trouble and stuff i see most depressed people are like that and the feeling i get when something triggers my depression is too much i think i have said this already in a different post but the thing that kills me is that i know that it s possible to get better and be happy but for me that s unobtainable i can not wait four years to get out of high school even if i somehow make it i will be forced into college which sounds alot harder i want to live and follow my dream but i just do not think i will ever be able to accomplish it with all that s going on i can not escape i do not want to die i have to die its the only way to escape and finally get rid of the pain if you can think of another way to escape please tell me because the only option for me right now is to die somehow somebody please talk me out of this before i actually make a plan i am in high school and i cant stand it everyone expects me to be able to just deal with it but i cant i constantly feel horrible because i am so easily triggered there are so many things that i want to do but cant because of school or unacceptance or something stupid like that its really starting to feel like i should not go on somebody please give me a reason i really do not want to have to o it	d
23080	this is what its come to im just gon na fucking do it i dont know what i am yet this turned into a book sorry hey guys dont really know where else to go now so ive always had issues since i was young reclusive anti social you know but then when i was 10 my dad died i was in shock for years so from then to 12 i was heavily depressed but i was so far deep in denial i didnt want to face that and this was also when i became interested in girls the first girl i ever became interested in was my best friend since i was 4 i spent my entire summer trying to get her to no avail since then im now 16 i have had major depression and self image issues my thoughts are why do these girls like these assholes should i quit should i also become an asshole i want to be loved to fill the void since the passing of my father i have no friends either theyve all moved on with their sos and left me in the dust so now im sitting here another walking statistic no friends no family i do actually have a family but they dont really care so i disregard them nobody there to help me out a little i am suicidal but im more angry like why the fuck does it have to be me why am i the one constantly getting shit one i mean ive actually completely lost it im a walking mental case i struggle more with ideas of homicide than suicide usually depends on the day i just dont know what to do anymore	c
23341	i have nothing left to give and what s left is an empty shell i am not good enough at anything to be able to get a job doing anything i actually enjoy by the time i might be good enough at something there will be at least 753 more people who are stillbetter than me i will never be enough i will never be good enough to have a job doing something i enjoy i will never be enough for a girl to be attracted to i will never have enough skill or ability to make something good or even decent there is nothing about me that is or ever will be enough i have had enough i have tried as hard as i can to live in this world i have tried as hard as i can to figure out what it is that i want in this world but anything i want to do is wildly invalid and impractical and it would not be enough to allow me to survive doing it in order to make it anywhere in this world i would have to do something that makes meemotionally and at times physically ill or at least it would have to be something that drains all senseof individuality i have left i do not even know who i am any more i think i have some ideas what i want to do but again those things that i might want to do are all things that are not worth following because theywill never allow me to support myself and be a productive member of society so the only way i can support myself and live in this world is to do things that erase any sense of selfand turn me into a cog in the machine or a robot with no soul i just want to be in the world and make people laugh and make them happy that is all i have ever wanted in this world but that is something i will never be able to do i see no reason to continue living i will never be able to do something that makes me happy because anything i try to do or makewill never be enough it will not be good enough nor will it be funny enough none of my efforts are worthwhile i do not want to continue fighting the unwinnable fight i know that there is the impossible dream motivation but that is not enough because again i will never be enough i will not ever be enough nothing i will ever make will be enough there is no point in continuing the struggle i have tried as hard as i possibly could i have done everything i could think of but even then i could not do enough there is no point there is nothing left i am finished	c
23374	i want someone to talk to i feel like a pathetic asshole asking for this but i know i need to i have been drinking tonight and going back and forth i know i am not going to do anything but i also want to feel like someone gives a shit and i do not feel like i have anyone i can really depend on my friends are not people i feel like i can rely on 100 % and my family i do not want to burden with my pain i just want someone to listen and i do not care if they really care or not but i want to feel like someone does care repeated i am sorry i do not want to burden anyone but when i drink it feels like the only time i have the courage to ask anyone to help me repeated	b
23400	it sall fucked anyway i am an alcoholic i am 25 all my friends have alienated me because i am such a fuckup my family is disappointed i really do not care for this world everyone i loved is dead they all died in my arms i am not as afraid of death as i am of life fuck this	c
26188	what are your reasons to keep living i am afraid of everything i have some stomach issues and although they truly would not run my life if i were not such a scared bitch all the time but i am i am a hypochondriac and have panic attacks all the time because of dumb things i am also socially awkward and anxious stopping me from making good friends getting a girlfriend even with those things i know i am living a fantastic life as compared to someone with true mental disorders or living in a third world country etc but why put up with it we will all end up dead either ashes in a jar or a body in a box 6 feet under i guess i d like to see how my life turns out but i am so afraid of the road ahead i can not stand it i guess that s all a bit off topic though although i am not directly suicidal i just want to ask you what are your reasons to continue living whats so damn great about life that you d like to force yourself through the hardships that are inevitable in every person s life is it survival is there something you want to complete what about when you have reached your goal would you be willing to die then i d love to experience dating a girl and having them truly enjoy my company but does it really matter it may or may not happen but even when it does i doubt i will be completely happy humans in nature always want more we could not possibly be happy with something forever list some of your reasons please	b
26542	how do i get the energy to fix myself there s so many things wrong with me right now most of them due to extreme social isolation between the ages of 6 to 21 roughly 6 months ago been trying to fix myself my life ever since yet any time i seriously want to try i just sit here and do nothing instead feeling miserable and hating myself i do not know why i do that but i know something needs to change considering the amount of suicidal thoughts i have been having lately good thing guns are illegal in my country how do you get the energy to improve yourself and meet people so you can allcaps finally allcaps stop being lonely i have friends but no girls which is really allcaps the allcaps thing that is pulling me down i could handle everything else but the thought of being forever alone is too much if you do not even have enough energy to get out of bed	b
26797	it s happening again i have had a really tough week and i thought that at least i wasn t suicidal this time and i could get through it but i am thinking about it again i keep picturing myself dying and wishing something would happen to me so i would not have to do it myself and my family would not have to deal with the burden of my suicide i keep trying to cheer myself up and nothing works trying to find a tiny shred of happiness within me i have no agency in my own life i might not have a job anymore by the end of the year and i have no prospects for the future i sense nobody wants to be around me anymore because i drag them down and i can not help being such a bore when i am barely alive i am a wreck and i keep getting worse i have had depression for six years anxiety for a bit less and i attempted suicide a little over a year ago i started going to therapy a month or so ago and it seems to help but it also brings out painful memories i am panicking way more frequently than i am used to i had a panic attack two days ago and i can barely hold it together now i keep crying at the drop of a hat and i can not sleep more than a few hours in a row today i woke up after a nightmare and my entire body hurt i lay there for a while crying intermittently and skipped going to work i hate that i am posting here it feels desperate i do not want to attempt suicide again i feel like surviving the last one was another chance at life but i am in so much pain and i am so tired i can not even picture having a future	c
27132	i can not do anything right no matter how i do it i constantly screw up i am a lazy retard who can not do anything right i feel like a waste of space i get good grades but to me that s not a representation of intellect i feel like just dying but i am afraid my loved ones will follow the same path which is why i would like help	b
27214	i am too apathetic to even kill myself anymore i just do not know what to do at all i just want to do it it would be so easy and simple and i could end all of this pain i woldn t have to hate myself every single day anymore i would not have to pretend like i am coping with these difficulties i just want it to be over and nothing will solve this in my near future there s so many ways i could do it it would be so easy and relieve me of this pain forever you do not know what it s like going through life despising yourself and everything you are everything in this world is against me even thought it is not i am going to end it edit in case anyone was wondering i did not go through with it i was just drunk and in a bad state of mind a friend helped me out i have been thinking about it a lot lately i have been depressed for as long as i can remember i do not want to live anymore but i also can not stand the thought of leaving my loved ones like that i will never be happy i hate myself no one cares about me everyone says it gets better and it does for a bit but then you come crashing back down i can not remember a time in my life where i was truly happy it s been so long	c
27262	just do not feel like living i know i may sound arrogant or ungrateful but i have what other people may think of as a privileged life im in college which my parents are paying for i know i have to find a job after graduating i must admit im not looking forward to the responsibilities of being an adult i do not have any major problems financial relationship or anything else really but somehow i feel like killing myself would be so easy that i should do it anyway and to me it would be no big deal honestly if i had a choice to not have been born or to die in my sleep tonight i d take it i have tried killing myself before helium but failed because of 1 tiny mistake im apathetic to how my family would feel if i did it i guess the real reason why i wan na do it is because of my outlook on life which is life is filled with ups and downs for most people including me and i guess im too lazy to deal with the responsibilities of an adult to me i d rather just be asleep forever to the people who want to say it will get better etc so what i will not be alive to regret it ignorance is truly bliss	c
27362	i was ready to give up well i will make no qualms about it i wanted to die dying was the only solution to my problem in my mind ai started to look for the fastest less painful ways i wanted to shot myself or hangmyself i fantasized about so many ways of dying throwing myself out of a tall building hanging myself from an electricalpole i thought i was done i had nothing else to offer the suffering was overwhelming and ever present i was only comfortable sleeping when i woke up i suffered from either anedhonia or profound sadness i had the deepest depression of my life i was ready to meet my maker i did not fear death for once i hungered for it i lusted for it i wanted it so much but then i met the most wonderful person this person brought life into my life this person made me feel special and wanted and needed this person told me i love you this person told me i was awesome and i meant the world to this person we have everything in common we make each other fell good and happy when we are together i feel i can do anything i have the confidence and the fortitude i lacked and i fell happy for once in my life just some food for thought guys if i had killed myself i wound allcaps not allcaps have felt this happiness and warmth i feel i found my soul mate sometimes dont deny yourself your future happiness you deserve it	b
27632	need to get everything out while i still can welcome to my pity party sit down comfortably take some tea and start wishing you could be somewhere else i was born in a disfunctionnal family my father is an alcoholic and suffers from bipolar disorder both things that heavilly runs into his familly my mother is allcaps also allcaps from a familly of alcoholic and while she is not one herself she is what is called co dependant aka dependant of the alcoholic person needless to say both of them grew up in disfunctionnal famillies as well and raised us as they had been never taking us seriously including never giving us any supports extremely variable discipline going from a total disinterest to dictator wannabee occasionnally even being physically abusive they allcaps always allcaps loved us but as they themselves admitted they were nowhere near ready to have children and it is extremely difficult to raise your children properly when you have never experienced it yourself i am the second of three children i have an older sister who is doing great for herself she left the mess of our home at 16 to join the canadian army she is well ranked is married to a fellow officer and has a wonderful familly better yet she was able to avoid the mistake my parents did and her children are the best behaved happiest children in the entire world i could not love them more i also have a younger brother concieved mere months after i was born i suspect he is an alcoholic much like my father but he s doing rather well for himself he s had his rough time but he has a job he s extremely qualified at has his own plot of land deep in the forest where my parents now live and he will soon build himself a home there as well then there s me the failure of the family i was always the black sheep in a familly of black sheeps from my most tender age i knew what i wanted to not be like them i said i would never allcaps ever allcaps touch alcohol that i would have a succesful life but nobody believed me because i was a bundle of problem i had a form of social retardation not intellectual just social allcaps adhd allcaps anxiety from birth and was extremely sensitive i acted wierd and everybody knew it especially at school i was kind and wanted nothing more than to love and be loved but the childrens took mad pleasure in torturing me instead physical and mental violence insults even sexual harrasment were all normal things for me growing up i knew it wasn t right but i could not do anything my parents were powerless to help me as they were either entangled in their own problems or prevented from doing anything by everyone else around the schools i went to prefered to blame them and myself for the bullying rather than the s good to point that my brother and sis were both social butterfly whenever they d have an intervention with the bullies they d focus about freaking racism despite the fact that this was in no way part of the am white so were all of my tormentors and as far as i know the single black kid at school never had any issues psychologist and such were a joke they were convinced i was simply paranoid were 100 % ready to diagnose me as such even after my mother gave testimony of many acts of bullying she had been a witness of they merely gave me a belated diagnosis of anxiety and called it a day needless to say such a childhood mess you up bad on top of everything i already had i developped borderline personality disorder a complete instability of emotions teachers and school officials had more reasons to hate me because i had extremely intense violent outburst from bottling up too much as my councellors adviced me to get stronger harden yourself do not show any emotions they will bully you even more repeated i never hurt anyone else but in their mind allcaps i obviously allcaps was about to i had always allcaps dreamed allcaps of studying and despite my allcaps adhd allcaps i was a great student curious and so always eager to learn but i had to leave school when i eventually had a long coming mental breakdown mental health specialist were no help i ended up rebuilding my mental psyche by myself as best as i could but the damage was long done i have been wandering ever since then trying and failling to build myself a life worth living i am now 27 and it s always been the same scenario whenever i think something is going right either my mental disorders or an outside agent comes to wreck everything up i have improved a lot for many of my mental trouble but handling all of them leaves me absolutely drained and i am still very vulnerable to relapse being so drained all the time i have difficulties with jobs i should be handling my own schedule working when i feel good but i find myself forced to work when i am already drained draining me even further allcaps i want allcaps to be my own boss i have the skills required to become a farmer today right now i studied for that i adore working with plants and know that as long as i respect my limit i could make myself a decent living i d never be rich but independance is all that i desire but i can not first because i have no money i am struggling to pay off debts i got trying and failling to improve my life second because i have no support recently when i had an opportunity to go back to school to work on my farming skills my father flat out told me to stop dreaming and start being happy with what you have i was discouraged and did what he said i now have lost my job because the tomato green house i am was working at is not producing enough tomatoes and they do not make enough profit to keep my job and others anymore i have allcaps nothing allcaps in front of me i have a boyfriend who adores me but i can not help but feel he should run away and save himself before i inevitably ruins his life as well i have pets i love all rescues but i can not help but feel i am neglecting them it s hard to get yourself to empty the cat s litter box when you are too depressed to even shower and feed yourself i am about 1 0 k in debts which may not seem like much but is a fortune when you are not able to work more than part time if at all everyone encourage me to live but it s hard when no matter where you look what you do you end up in deep shit i am a good person i do not drink just like i said when i was a kid i do not do drugs do not smoke i do my best to pay off my debts but nothing s working i do not know if i would have the guts to just off myself i am too scared of hurting those i love but there are time very very frequent time where i wish i could just leave everything behind get myself a cabin somewhere lost in the deepest corner of the planet and see how long i could survive away from everything from everyone at least there i d have a chance of survival not so with this slow agony that is my life	b

18616	i need something so i do not really know what to say here i have been thinking about suicide for awhile on and off for months but lately it s been more frequent more reaccuring and the logic of it all seems to be pointing more and more towards just showing myself out the door i do not know what to do i do not know how to drag myself out of this hole but i know the booze and the cigarettes and the weed are not helping they are only band aids and the cost more money than i have to spend i am 21 male and i guess i d say i am suicidal because there just does not seem anything left to do i am in debt up to my eyeballs with school and bills and i am not bringing in enough money from work or my loans to pay off my bills and keep ahead and i feel like i am constantly mouching sp off my friends and family to try and stay afloat i have a constant sense of dread and doom and do not feel like anything that i can do will change that i feel like a burden even as i am typing this my plea for help i just keep thinking to myself clayton be a man leave these people alone so they can help someone who needs it and i do not know how to sit down and say help me please i am so scared i threw away the woman i proposed to because of our lond distance relationship i was content but not happy i got into a whirlwind relationship with a woman we moved into this apartment got that cat over there and then she left me for another man a week after we paid our first months rent that was in february i dropped out of college to pay my bills re enrolled in summer classes and am trying to look forward to my fall schedule but i can not i look at my schedule and all i see is stress and bills and lack of time for everything i just want release i do not want to face my family and friends or be a burden and honestly it s the idea of them having to bury me and take care of all the bills and junk that i will leave behind that has always stopped me sure i will get release from my bills but someone will have to pay them someone will have to take care of my cat someone repeated and it s just the idea of forcing my problems on to other people that i can not stand and i do not want to live anymore but if i die i will be even more of a burden than i already am so i have to suck it up and keep trying to make ends meet that are never going to i will answer a few questions that i think are going to be posed before i wrap this book up i can not move in with my mom due to issues involving the adoptio of my newphew and his serious medical condition they can not accept me back in with them i have friends i could couch surf with but only for a few weeks at a time i already live in low income housing and am food stamps to try to support myself all of my bills are non negotiable and i have tried to shift things as much as possible to take some of the stress off but so far with no real change in anything in fact i have a therapist but i can not justify the co payment for an appointment the last time i got sick the co payment for a doctors visit and meds made me miss my electric bill that s how tight my finances are yea repeated so i am tempted to delete all this just so i do not bother you but i think it s time someone anyone knew what keeps me up at 4 am	c

19058	stuck i am severely behind in my school work with finals week being next week my teachers all hate me my parents know how big a shit head i am my friends are all fighting and the group is being torn apart i am probably not going to get the grades that will allow me to go back to college in the fall i feel sick and scared all the time 24 7 literally no stops i feel ugly and useless and like just a basically shitty person i tried to kill myself a few weeks ago with pils but i did not take enough to die and my friend has now hidden all the medication in his room where i can not get to it i am stuck here and i do not know what to do and i do not think i can fix everything i do not know what i am asking for here i do not think i am looking for anyone to talk me out of suicide or to tell me its going to get better i guess i just feel like here people will listen to me i am a lazy asshole and i now feel like allcaps i need allcaps to kill myself every problem i have comes from me being a bum i have and never have had any ambition and my mom s one of those moms that reads those stupid parenting books so she assumes i am supposed to have tons of ambition because i am the oldest kid so to her i am a titanic fucking disappointment when i wake up in the morning i have no drive to go to class and 24 7 i just keep thinking about how much i suck and how much i do not want to be alive i have been a christian my whole life but now that i am in college just keeping doubting that there even is a god i have been told by christians that if you commit suicide you automatically go to hell and that is the most painful thing for me to hear because i want to do it so bad i masterbate at least 3 times every day and that used to make me happy but now it does not and it s just an addiction i get mad at people for random shit and i feel terrible for it and today my mom found out from my adviser that i have been sleeping through classes and she told me she s not gon na help me pay for college anymore and i feel like she would be so much better off and so much happier if i wasn t here she and my dad allcaps depleted their retirement funds allcaps so they could help my pay tuition and i can not even fucking wake up in the morning i feel like the biggest piece of shit in the entire fucking world and a waste of space and i just feel like if i kill myself i will be correcting a mistake	d
19239	i just cant seem to get help i talk to my friends about how i feel and i try to get help but i cant get them to listen i want to have reasons to stick around i want people to know that i am hurting but i just can not get anyone to notice i am jolly on the outside but that makes it so much harder to get them to listen please somebody tell me what s wrong	b
19250	game over l am tired hoping that things will get better l am tired of people telling that everything will be okay l know that there is a lot of people that relate to me and that might know how l feel but then they will just go on and tell me their life story and telling me how things got better for them l do not want to hear that l do not want this to be a contest of who had it worse and who almost pulled the plug l m tired of waiting and waiting and waiting l am tired of living in this house l am tired of trusting people with my heart l am tired of him living in my head he will not leave no matter what l do he will not leave l have tried everything l can but he still stays there and he will not do not want to know if things will get better in the future hell things will probably get even worse later on l do not want to live with that and l really do not want to live right now l do not want to wake up every morning and have the only thing l look forward to is going back to sleep l wake up and just imagine how everything would be if l was gone no more of my sisters coming over and trying to help me no more of me crying to my friends no more of me l do not want to be a burden earlier this morning l swallowed around 12 pills of tylenol but l ended up hovering over the toilet throwing all of them up and my last meal l am so fucking tempted to get a knife and just slit my throat or stab myself in the chest or just down whatever pills are laying around in my house l am tired of being tired and l do not want to deal with it anymore at least l get to see my mom if l end up going through with it	d
19254	help her out girl is ready to commit suicide once her pets are rehomed allcaps please allcaps let us help her out	a
19510	do not turn into me because of me repeated there s only one person in the world who i spill my heart and mind to and in all honesty i am afraid that it might hurt allcaps him allcaps mentally someday one of the reasons i am now seeing a therapist sometimes i am in a particularly repeated self hating repeated mood i guess is the best way to put it and i lay down and i cry and i tell him all the reasons why i deserve to die i am a leach when it comes to money i do not try to be it just happens most of the time i am a burden on everyone i meet they can deny it all they want i am an emotional sledge hammer i do not have any friends and i feel that almost everyone i have met over the course of being at this new school fucking hates me i do not see myself living any grand life i do not see much purpose in it and because the world is a shithole i blame that on lack of money i just feel like my issues weigh heavy on people other than me and i feel like the sooner i kill myself the sooner people can be free of the burden that is me i am scared of growing up i am 22 i am scared of going through all the adult things like repeated bills and taxes and mortgages and all that fun stuff one of the many reasons i have decided to be childfree is to try and make that easier i am just another person in the crowd when i die the world will move on everyone will learn to move on it ll be no different than swatting a fly my fiance repeated he repeated tries to help me it seems like when he comes to me and holds me i start to calm down but what do i do when i have an episode and he is not there i even sat down with him and told him what i wanted him to do in the event that i did finally kill myself i feel so bad that i felt the need to do that but everytime i write a letter i tend to get bored or something with it i hope he does not end up like me allcaps because allcaps of me and i d keep it in but sometimes it s too much to keep in and he s the only person in the world i have repeated everyone else abandoned me for one reason or another repeated or no reason i am just left with no explanation left to wonder what i did wrong repeated the sad repeated but maybe fortunate part repeated is despite how i sometimes want to die so very badly repeated i am also conveniently scared of dying and i have only once come close to killing myself if it wasn t for the lack of money for allcaps how i allcaps wanted to i d probably be dead right now probably	c
19537	i have not felt this out of control in a long time i have not posted here in awhile i thought i was doing better but i am not i get out of my financial hole but i still feel crushed i have a good relation with my x wife and her child but i still feel alone i keep thinking what is the point of fighting if i will never win would not it just be easier to give up and die i am so scared to die but all i think about is killing myself please send me some kind words i want to live today is the first day i have really thought about killing myself since my wife moved out i was doing so well with everything even better then her but today as i was crying i thought i heard her say my name i am all alone i do not know if i can live with this heart ache any longer i know that i could win her back its the slow passage of time that that is killing me how do you go on when my heart hurts so bad there is a literal pain in my chest my heart is breaking i can feel it i do not want to die over this going to the hospital will not help this time my wife the only person to ever loved me has stopped caring for me she has become such a selfish person i thought she changed from the hurtful person i meet three years ago but she has no problem hurting me today she told me it was my fault because i let her treat me this way if that s how it s going to be i do not want do it anymore i do not think my death will really effect her i want to kill her and then myself i just want her to hurt as bad as i do	c
19788	i am literally a ghost i have posted here before i tried to make life better it worked but not for long it s gotten worse i have progressively gotten more depressed i think and i am at a crossroads almost one road is try to make this better despite how hard and shitty it s gon na be and the other i guess is just killing myself it s not like anybody would care sure a few people would but yeah mostly aeveryone would just be like huh repeated shit happens i guess does not fucking help either when you hear your own parents having a discussion over how shitty of an antisocial unmotivated hideous loser they have raised you are probably wondering why i say i am a ghost well that s because i basically am one i talk to almost nobody nobody talks to me all i do on weekends is just sit up here in my room and be on my computer for like 10 hours now that school is over and summer is here my dad is constantly fucking pestering me to get a job he does not think of my social anxiety as anything he does not know how fucking hard it is for me to talk to new people maybe the problem is me and maybe it always has been maybe the reason i am so sad is because of myself i do not talk to people or ask anyone to do anything because all i am ever gon na get is a no or a sorry maybe another time i just have no fucking clue what to do with my shitfest of a life i just do not know what to do i am not thinking of committing suicide i just really need to vent and get some advice or something cause i feel like the shittiest shit that s ever been shat i feel like teenagers are not supposed to go through this yet i am why because i am so fuckin socially awkward and i look like a fucking train wreck and i am beginning to feel like i have this vibe to me that screams to people stay away even though thats the complete opposite of what i want i do nothing with people on weekends and after school nobody ever asks me if i want to do shit with them i feel like most of this all sort of started when for the first goddamn time in my life i had a girlfriend she made me feel loved then we broke up 2 fucking weeks later and things kinda went to shit for me as for being antisocial basically through grade 8 and 9 i was really weird and i was kind of just in my own world and was detached from everybody yes i still talked to people but well i dunno i want to try and change this but i never ask people to do stuff because there s always this fear i have of hearing no because that s always been the outcomethanks	b
19916	1 8 yo cancer tonight s the night i am busted out i have got spinal cancer most likely terminal i love someone and she said that she has a new boyfriend now my impulse was to lash out at her but i did not want do something that would ruin someone s life who might not deserve it but mine s wearing thin i do not want to walk around seeing her every day in school i do not want to see her get kissed by someone else but me until i die of the lamest disease ever i think i will go out tonight it seems like the best thing to do i hate everything here s my favourite song i always liked music the national val jester	d
34032	i let everyone down including myself i am sick of life and i have been feeling this way for 3 years hi i am a teenage male my name is reece i have been suffering from severe clinical depression for at least 3 years maybe longer probably longer i cut myself a lot i actually just relapsed after being clean for 9 months 9 fucking months thrown away i met a girl about a year and a half ago that always helps me through everything and just over 9 months ago i asked her out because her and i were honestly almost 100 % similar and she said yes i asked her just before i stopped cutting and she stopped around the same time too she s still strong and has not had even a thought of self harm again but i just started doing it again about a week ago and she does not know yet i did it for a while before we were together too she thinks i have not done it since then anyway with the relationship stuff she s really the only person that cares and allcaps i always allcaps feel i am bothering her or annoying her whenever i am telling her about how i feel every single time there is only one other person i can talk to and i also feel i bother this person i often just sit alone and keep everything to myself i feel ugly i feel annoying i feel unwanted i feel alone i know i let everyone down i hate myself and so on i have felt this way for so long i can not even remember no one supports me at all everyone in my school either avoids me or says something about how i should go kill myself or how i am a faggot or whatever that really does not help i have terrible anxiety and terrible trust issues i hurt everyone around me due to that my parents and brother do not know about this they thought i just had minor issues in the past they all know i used to cut but again none of them know i relapsed they all think i am happy and they all think i am doing better but i am not i can not remember the last time i was truly happy whenever i feel a little better or i feel decent there is always something that will fuck it up every single time someone says something someone does something whatever literally every time there is something to ruin my happiness i put on a fake smile every single day no one knows that of people try to communicate with me or say something to me and honestly i do not want anything to do with them because they are all fake i am told very often i am worthless people always stare at me awkwardly i always hear people talking about me even in public all of the religious fucks at my school tell me i am going to hell for this and that i am not really religious at all but that s just annoying there are so many people that can say they hate me and i only have two people to ever go to about my problems other people say they will be there but they end up screwing me over for example this one girl i used to be friends with i will not say her name her and i would talk to each other often whenever we were feeling down and i thought she was a friend i later found out she would talk about me behind my back she would post my secrets on facebook and tumblr and she would spread everything she would lie to me about a lot you get it that s happened a few times actually i only trust my girlfriend only her no one else i have been taken advantage of i have been beaten up you name it guys have tried to rape me for fuck s sake i am often told by people that somehow found out about my issues probably from that girl i just mentioned and they say it s all a lie because i am not a girl they think only girls can be sad and cut themselves and starve themselves they are so fucking blind i could go on and on about these people anyone who says they are here for me is a big fucking liar no one else that i call a friend even has the slightest idea of how i am i could go on and on and on about my shitty life but i think i will stop soon i have left a lot unsaid i have not had any thoughts or attempts of suicide in a while but tonight that s different i am seriously on edge right now i hate this stupid fucking hell that i call my life i am seriously going to scream if someone generically says oh it will get better that s probably the biggest lie i have ever heard sorry for the long post	c
34078	the thought of killing myself makes me feel a lot better i have been ideating suicide for a few years now it wasn t until recently that the thought of following through made me feel better now when i am feeling particularly low during the day the thought minimizes a lot of the negative feelings when i remind myself that some day i am going to kill myself a lot of the pain and self loathing dissipates temporarily i have to assume that this is not healthy there are a few reasons i have not yet killed myself maybe you can relate to this list kiss fear that i will fail the percentage of successful suicide attempts is extremely low i have tried to hang myself two times the belt buckle broke under my weight both times i learned how to tie a noose out of electrical cord it s in my dresser fear that it will hurt self explanatory i am terrified that the last thing i will experience will be excruciating physical pain my family will miss me fear that people friends family will think i killed myself for attention fuck people who say this shit my sister slit her wrists late last year my mom still claims that it was petty and that she did it for attention thankfully my sister lived i do not know if my mom has expressed these opinions to her but the fact that she actually seems to think that is unsettling i do not want my family or anybody to find my body i will be decaying with shit and piss in my pants very likely i imagine there are fewer things worse than finding a hanged body can anybody recommend some good books on existentialism i am not looking for feel good books or anything religious i do not want to learn how to win friends and influence people either i want to understand or disprove my ever present feelings of hopelessness nihilism and my contempt for humankind advice welcome	c
34247	yup so repeated the only reason i have not already offed myself is because i am lazy gluttonous keep making excuses and am too much of a pussy to get it over with repeated i mean i already figured out a nice painless method that s at least 95 % lethal and even if it goes wrong on that 5 % it s still painless just slower repeated i already have all the necessary materials and could easily implement the plan anytime and i am reasonably sure that i would not be interrupted were i to take action hell it s really just a matter of time and i d already planned a long time ago that i d never live past 40 i am currently 21 repeated i just can not see a viable future in which i can live comfortably and happily and yet repeated i can not seem to bring myself to push the final button metaphorically speaking everything is in order i have already written all the letters i needed to write in order to answer the potential questions i might leave in the minds of those i d be leaving behind and i am reasonably certain that my siblings and parents could live on comfortably financially speaking were i to pass on i have even finished my last will and testament the only thing i have not done yet is delete and format the hard drive containing all the porn i accumulated over the years nothing illegal just somewhat embarrassing the honest truth is that at first i just wanted to coexist peacefully with everyone just get along and do my own thing but then people would not simply leave me alone then i revised my goals i wanted to make friends talk to people live my life to the fullest but then reality set in and i found myself struggling like a slug on a racetrack made of salt and copper then there s my siblings my youngest brother does not need me he s got his own friends and life that he can live happily with he s young enough that within 20 years he will not even remember me my little sister and i do not get along anymore we grew apart and i do not know why we used to be thick as thieves back in the day now she can not stand the sight of me and gets angry at everything i do even if it does not affect her bloody unreasonable she is can not even simply coexist anymore no live and let live philosophy with her my father s a good man and means well and he will probably be hit the hardest when i go i love him and he deserves better but i do not know how much longer i can go on the way i am something s gon na break and it s gon na be soon i can feel it my mother repeated means well she s a fairly nice person overall but she s also overbearing as fuck devout catholic and actively opposes anything outside her personal beliefs frankly i am sick and tired of her shit even though i love her and care about her well being she s caused me some trauma in the past spankings telling me to leave the house telling me that she has no son and that she s no longer my mother repeated she took it back and asked for forgiveness which i forgave but not completely it still hurts i could never tell her of course it d break her heart more than it hurts mine and i do not plan on sticking around as long as she does i was already suicidal before it it just reinforced my convictions i have already sought help i have been to counseling psychology and psychiatry i can not put any faith into the ridiculousness of religion and no amount of drugs or alcohol can fix what i have permanently truth be told the help i sought pretty much ruined my future prospects because of my own gods damned help seeking i was put in a school for the emotionally disturbed aka school for problem kids thus i made no friends have none and never learned to make any because of their shitty teaching i can not even be called a highschool level student as the highest subjects they taught were basic algebra it s fucking pathetic so here i am at the end of my rope and yet i am too much of a cowardly procrastinator to just put an end to it more than likely i will have one or two people come in and tell me something like you need to get help or that s rough dude you wan na talk about it and it ll work in the short term repeated but then a week later i will be back just as if not more depressed and suicidal than i already am life is tough and this world is a shitty game in which you can not win or break even today i came dangerously close it felt like a breaking point as i type this up i am this close to simply giving up and ending it all i already know how i d do it but this sub does not allow explicity i tried to explain it to my mother but she gave me the generic we should be thankful for what we have many other people do not so we should speechi m so tired of the depression the hateful sister the family that s constantly condescending i am so tired of life and the world and people and things and so on this has been going on for far too long i have dragged this out and it s my own damn fault i should have ended it years ago as a teen but i foolishly thought it ll get better i will grow up and live my life and hopefully become happy but it did not now i am tired worn down and miserable i am unemployed overweight world weary and lonely as hell no friends nobody i would truly consider family save for my parents and maybe my little brother i can not even get a nice stiff drink or smoke some weed i am so broke i can not possibly imagine a scenario in which this travesty of a life could get any better i do not want to deal with this bullshit any longer i used to come here on my main account to help people and most of them that i have stayed in contact with are doing well i never thought i d be posting here	d
34268	i do not want history to repeat itself but it feels like trying to hold back the god damn sea repeated a few years ago i broke up with my first boyfriend was living with my parents and was very depressed depressed over things like the way my life was going and things like the way the world is i tried to kill myself twice and ended up in a mental hospital for two weeks repeated and then was released without any follow up because i moved country fast forward five years and my ex is leaving me i am going to have to move back in with my parents again and all i feel is that horrible choking pressure around my neck again every time i come round my parents my mum tells me how much she loves me and how she could not live without me and it just makes me feel worse i feel so fucking guilty for even thinking about this i just feel like some people myself included are destined to commit suicide like there s no other option for me it s a foregone conclusion	d
34464	best only friend betrayed me and now i feel like dying i have suffered with depression and anxiety for quite a while pretty severely in fact as well as being socially awkward and not having any friends anyway i am 16 17 met a girl online gaming turns out she was in the same state blah blah we become awesome best friends we meet up we are awesome friends for about 4 years she knew i had depression and anxiety and all that stuff but she did not know that i was self harming and thinking about suicide since she was my only and bestest friend who i treated like family because of me having family issues i knew i could trust her because she even said herself i could tell her about anything so i told her she calls me a case a bad friend and that i should just go and kill myself so other people do not have to put up with my shit she then continued to remove and block me on every form of communication we had as you can imagine this really hurt now this is not the only reason i have been thinking about suicide but it is the reason that pushed me over the edge and think what s the point anymore on top of all this i have been trying to meet new friends people while gaming and she is going around telling them all oh do not add talk to him he is insane he will betray you or will tell all your secrets to people when these are all lies and as you can imagine it s then incredibly hard for me to keep those people i am trying to become friends with near me it s all just too much for me too be honest i am seeing a psychologist and a doctor but i just do not know how to feel anymore and i feel that being dead is the only right thing for me in this world	c
34502	i hope it s not a joke i have been feeling awful lately extremely depressed suicidal the other day i was talking to my best friend and she said in a kinda joking manner that when we are old and our respective partners have died me and her should buy a house and live together she said we should have a whole heap of pets and an indoor swimming pool i said i wanted a granite kitchen with one of those centre islands that have a pot rack above we talked like this for a few hours she has no idea how bad it s gotten for me lately i feel like i can not tell anyone right now the hope of that house is all i have to live for it s the only thing stopping me from offing myself i really hope she was being serious because i was i am i want that damn house	c

i am a loser that i failed them and how i am in such a mess of my own doing i can not do this anymore i was going to file for bankruptcy but can not afford the fees so i am facing complete financial ruin i do not know if i will be able to get another job now i wanted so many things like i wanted to travel more and i wanted a better future with my boyfriend whom i live with my parents would be better off without me as i have realized and i can not keep putting him through more pain i just want it to end i am sick of my circumstances and i am sick of being in such a dark place i have been staring at my ibuprofen and his painkillers and i just want to end it all i never thought i d have to come back here but repeated here i am for the past almost two years i was starting to do better last week my 15 month relationship with a great guy ended i was still having thoughts of wanting to end it and flares of my depression but i thought i was happy enough that they went away now i am here again my whole body feels heavy and i just want the pain to end i want me to end i do not know what to do if there s someone here please help me i do not want to feel like this anymore i was raped again i do not want to do this anymore i was raped by my friend while i was drunk and he was sober i have had enough it s like i can not catch a break and everything is just going to get worse how do i come back from this can i i really do not feel like i can and i just want out i hate my mother and ex boyfriend for making me keep myself alive all of my friends too in fact most of my other family is minding their own lives or have cut me away so it s really just them i have wanted to for months it s come and gone and there have been little things that have made me want to stick around this coupled with years of depression and anxiety have been the driving force in it along with a lot of the events of the past half year my dad and sister left us so it s just me and my mom now if i die she will have no one left i hate that i am her only system of support and i hate that i would do that to her for years it s just been me and her it will continue to just be me and her and i hate her for that i still love my ex one of my closest friends of five years despite everything that happened this is probably the truest love i have ever felt and i d give anything to have it back despite how close we still are now he had nightmares that i d kill myself and he sobbed when i told him i had considered it he lost his mother i can not do that to him i do not hate him for his grief but i hate him for keeping me from doing it i wish he d never shown his devotion to me or made me as happy as he did i really hate how my friends depend on me and tell me how much they want me around because it makes it so much harder for me to proceed with it i hate them for knowing i d hurt them i wish they had just not cared it would make it so much easier i hate all of them and i wish they did not care i am studying in germany next month yeah call me ungrateful but i really wish i did not have to leave repeated and if it were not such a hassle i d just throw myself into the river i just want it to end and i wish i could be alone i just can not i was given and not warned about the side effects i went crazy i got depressed i lost him i lost most of my semester i lost my sanity repeated i feel like i have lost everything he found out about it but he said nothing he does not care i trusted my doctor and i feel like i have nothing and no one left because i lost myself i want to be dead i wish i were dead what do i have left anyway nothing helps anymore it s all worthless my parents will get by just fine without me and my friends will move on and he will not care repeated i am sorry i am tired of crying i am tired of being angry and resentful and hurt i am done i want out maybe i d be better off my anxiety has ruined my life it ruined the best relationship i have ever had it s dented my studies and i can barely get out of bed anymore i feel like i have no one i wish i could just repeated die quietly i really do not want to be here anymore i do not want what s happening to me to run my life anymore i hate this back and forth i wish i just had the gall to do it i do not get what s holding me back from it anymore i am sorry i can not really breathe right now and i am desperately trying to hold back tears and wonder why i do not have the nerve to just up and do it thanks for listening do any of you feel like you are only keeping yourself alive for someone else i know i have been posting here a lot and i am sorry i do not want to be alive anymore honestly i just do not feel any happiness anymore and do not see any reason to keep myself here i am estranged from both my father and my sister and by extension also from my niece my mother is dying because she s caused herself so much damage from years of alcohol and prescription drug abuse i am not with the person i love the most anymore and by extension also have lost my friend of almost five years i do not want to be here every day is a struggle to get out of bed and i just do not feel any joy but i have stopped every time i wanted to it s a constant thing every friend that i have not turned away from has begged me not to even the ex of mine he s said that he has a recurring nightmare that i do and he cried when i told him i almost did in january but after this i am not sure it still applies because we still have not spoken unless any of you can give me insight i feel like the only reason i am still alive is because i do not want to hurt the other people in my life i do not even want to live for myself anymore do any of you feel this way i am not sure why this happened repeated i almost killed myself this week the only reason i am still alive is a close girlfriend stepped in after i called her begging for help i do not want to be alive but i do not want to die either my ex and i have been in a weird limbo for months we care so much for each other and were regretful about the end of our relationship but we were too scared and i was too scared to admit the depth of my depression and anxiety which led to my meltdown our fight our breakup when i told him everything he felt immense guilt because he did not realize what had happened and he said this is my fault you can not take any blame for it we were starting to open up to each other and admitted that was the best conversation we had had in months he had also admitted to me a recurring nightmare that i do commit suicide and it was his fault i told him i almost did and he was so upset he sobbed and nearly disconnected our skype call the whole of last week he would call me but he sounded very tired awkward sad and kind of distant my mother had almost killed herself too and i am in the process of putting her into a rehab facility i was so angry at everyone in my life both of them especially and i had just shut down when i finally told him that i was on the brink on saturday i was lashing out because anxiety and hormones and just upset after i told him i almost killed myself he was in shock and hurt but he said i can not tell him these things anymore because nothing he says helps me that is not true but it may have sounded like that from my frustration we bickered and i asked if he s hurt me enough i regretted it the moment i said it but after some stunned silence he said have not you hurt me enough he hung up and we have not spoken since and i have been a mess i do not understand because he was so compassionate to me before and the months after our split but now repeated i do not get it i spent the few nights after with my friend who knows what i am going through i am not repeated suicidal anymore even though i wish i could end my life i am just confused now and hurt thanks for listening to me repeated i just wish i could understand why would he react like that i can not do this anymore i do not know what happened i am hoping that soon my mom will be back in western new york we live in ma with her family and my father and her granddaughter so at least she will not feel so alone when it happens i do not feel like i can handle what s happening to me anymore i thought i could but i guess i can not my sister told my mom i am graduating with a degree i can do nothing with and am incapable of living on my own or doing anything repeated maybe she s right my upset is so bad that i have both shunned so many friends and have made the ones that i still spoke to both wary and starting to avoid me they do not understand how bad it actually is in my head because i am scared and anxious to tell them i have not told my ex how bad things actually are which i probably should have because this depression and anxiety was masked and he interpreted it as something else and left me we still talk have not in a couple of days but he s totally clueless as to what is going on i still love him and he still cares it seems but i am too scared to say anything i can not do this anymore i can not even with quitting drinking i am still despaired in my thoughts i want it to end i do not want to exist anymore people will be able to go on without me the little things in life do not feel like enough to stop this pain i am sorry this may not be entirely comprehensible but i am shaking with tears right now i just want it to be over repeated i do not want to be alive anymore i am not thinking about ending it but i really really wish i were not alive i know that this would normally be the kind of topic for r depression but i do not feel like i can speak comfortably there anymore the short of it is that in the course of two months i have lost just about everything i totalled my car in a weather related accident lost my job because of the injuries from said accident and my partner and i split up and that s even more complicated i have lost the will to live i do not care about my studies anymore my mom does not have much time left here because she s chosen to not take care of herself anymore after my father left and it feels like everything else is just falling apart i have a lot of friends but most i can not even look at and can not even speak to the ones i have kept close just can not understand i can not do this anymore i really really wish i could just end it the only reason i have not is because i am all my mother has left but i do not want to be alive anymore i do not even know what i want thanks for letting me say this	d

30010	how to deal with irrational guilt for the last few years i have been suffering from an inability to let things go i feel like a horrible scumbag for something i said when i was 6 now 18 and have the bad habit of taking the blame from other people just to try and usually fail which makes me feel worse to help them feel better some days i feel like everyone i know would be way way better off without me how do i let mistakes go how do i let other people make mistakes without trying to be a martyr life turned to hell back in 12 and really it s the same maybe i have just gotten better at coping and i think i have but that urge to end it all is still there perhaps less strong but i understand that it s not supposed to be this way is it i just do not know anymore =	b

31623	money problems make me want to go sometimes i know i will never kill myself but i do not know repeated i am 25 and young but i am sick of being constanly in debt and unable to catch up because one thing after the next happens and both my jobs have had piece of shit bosses including this one where they just fucking flipped the entire script on me hired me for a job with one boss 2 weeks and one small argument with the psycho other boss who you would not have taken the job if you knew he d be your boss and suddenly he s my boss and i am doing nothing that had to do with the job i actually signed up for seriously considering legal council and have already started seeing a councilor but fuck repeated but then again repeated i do not have the money fuck i am trying to find a new job and i need to stop smoking pot but its difficult when you are fucking miserable every winter in chicago i do not know it s just getting hard and really fucking me up i hate money my councilor told me to call 911 if my friend ever hints at suicide while high on duster on the phone with me repeated i hope i did the right thing is there anyway you can make someone see a therapist my friend is addicted to air duster and has a bunch of other issues i need help so my friend whose issues can somewhat be summed up in this post here however she has recently been calling me on nights where she has been huffing air duster and being very high she mentions symptoms to me of wanting to vomit she has hyperventilated numerous times while on the phone with me and also seems to be talking to things that are not there she claims that she does not have a problem or an addiction to the air duster and i have tried numerous times to convince her to seek help i have even threatened to call an ambulance when she does not speak clearly or i can not understand the answers to her questions i really do not know what i should do i need advice i want to help her is there a way for me to get her help without her willingly accepting it edit she also tells me she wants to die and when i tell her not to say things like that or i ask why she says i do not understand what is going on in her head in reference to the voices and the things she sees r i was sent here for this i need advice i have a friend who will remain nameless for reasons that will become obvious who needs some serious help she has clinical depression and schizophrenia she hears voices that tell her to do things and also sometimes claims to see them she also harms herself quite a bit usually by the method of cutting but also has the tendency to use airduster and overdose on pills occasionally i met her last summer and i tried to get her help it got so bad to the point that she was cutting and telling me that she wanted to die everyday so i nearly forced her and finally convinced her to go to the hospital she spent 3 days at linden oaks medial group a place for people with behavioral and dangerous mental disorders and came home and was doing well for a while and then she relapsed again and again she has since then become engaged and she is not quite as bad as she used to be but recently like the last 2 weeks or so she seems to be a lot more depressed and would cut herself more and more each day tonight is where i am finally reaching out to reddit for advice since apparently she has been to rehab many times and continuously has relapsed i have suggested that she see a psychiatrist but she refuses to because she does not think that it will help and money is an issue she is also worried because her fiance thinks that she has stopped cutting and apparently will leave her if he finds out i just do not know what to do anymore reddit and i want her to get better i need to know what i can do	b
31683	suicidal thoughts while on lexapro so about one or two months ago i started taking lexapro for my anxiety it also turned out to get rid of the constant homicidal thoughts i had been having for a long time i never told anyone about them for obvious reasons until after the lexapro made them go away so my psychiatrist suggested i keep taking it and said he d consider raising the dosage but recently i started getting suicidal thoughts and a issue i had a few days ago with my friend is just making them worse i do not know if i should tell my psychiatrist i am afraid he might take me off lexapro and the homicidal thoughts might come back i just can not take them at least with suicidal thoughts people feel sympathy for you instead of fear i lost my best friend because of the homicidal thoughts even though i have no control over them and would never act on them at least with suicidal thoughts i do not think i am a bad person i am pretty much fucked whether i tell him or not i do not know what to do i feel like just putting up with the suicidal thoughts would be easier	c

25059	just a message for anyone i used to be depressed constantly even on good days i could be in the sunshine and just not want to do anything but die then i sort of got caught up in some sort of world epiphany i do not know how to describe it maybe this sounds stupid but everything gradually just sort of repeated connected i can not pinpoint when it started or what caused it but i had a major shift in how i perceive things i became amazed with ever little thing and the art and beauty of the world think about the very pillars that make up our incredibly complex life here on earth millions of creatures eating breathing living and dying killing one another or living side by side all of this creates a magnificent symphony of equilibrium and homeostasis to truly understand the inner workings of these life characteristics and how our world works would take a lifetime the simple act of an animal going about life is complex the act of breathing sleeping and thinking with so many hormones and chemicals deciding so many outcomes all of it working together is amazing yet that same form of complexity is also present down to each and every single cell such as bacteria feeding or plants performing photosynthesis i am truly amazed every time i think about how amazing it is that the world works so well with so many moving parts let alone with human beings causing more and more problems every year now imagine all of that complexity and expand it outwards as well for the same form of distinguishing push and pull this evolution of external forces changing and adapting also extends to the stars black holes dying stars gas clouds and wayward asteroids form massive changes outside our field of vision where we are just now beginning to gain sight of among all of this one shudders to imagine what great marvels lay beyond visible galaxies and our known universe itself does it go on forever does it end with a quiet fade into the endless abyss it is in our very nature to ask questions and our beautiful universe proposes so many i just wanted to say to everyone out there you have no idea how many people out there are feeling and thinking the way you are maybe it takes companionship maybe it takes some sort of change in your emotions i do not know allcaps but allcaps and this is important you can allcaps never allcaps give up something or someone will find you and you allcaps will allcaps get past it you have to believe it i had no hope at all once and i was ready to kill myself so please just hold on every single person is special and you deserve to give yourself a chance i just feel like i had to put this out there for everyone	a

25776	i am sending out my e love to you all right now i hope the message in this video helps you out like it has for me buying beer for sw ers hey all i am troubled by the recent spike in men offering to buy beers for people who are suicidal or have suicidal ideations there was someone who spoke up about it albeit a little sarcastic and downvoted to hell he was absolutely right in saying that the last thing we should be doing is offering to give alcohol to someone who is suicidal or having thoughts of killing themselves i understand that you are just trying to be genuine and friendly but when it comes to saving someone s life being genuine and friendly does not help allcaps especially allcaps if it involves substances i think we the helpers on sw need to be better educated on ways to help those who are reaching out to us in that critical moment where life and death are both in delicate reach lets have an educated and thoughtful discussion on this before someone does something unintentional and another person could potentially end up dead have you spoken to my friend hey everyone my friend is very near and dear to my heart and i actually met him on this about 9 months ago most of you who frequent here know of him he s the boy from serbia anyways he normally talks about suicidal ideation and his problems in life but for us its just been me helping him talk through his emotions and he s usually fine by the end of the day however his last post on facebook was pa zbogom which means well goodbye and i have not heard from him he posted that just on monday but honestly its unusual for us to go that long without talking we talk on average at least once a day if not multiple times have you seen any posts on here from him recently and have any of you talked with him in the last 48 hours tl dr my friend is missing have you spoken to him this song has kept me going i think it can help you too	a

20007	the most consistent desire i have had all my life is the desire to die i still want to and i am planning to do it to be blunt i find the act of living to be horrible in my experience people are not nice to each other and are most commonly plain abusive i was sexually assaulted as a child by a woman hired to take care of me because i am a man i have been told that this actually is not possible because of my gender and also told to stop using the word rape to describe the experience i have been told this people who supposedly love me my first suicide attempt was in grade school and was on campus i was using a knife and was working up the courage for a particularly deep cut when a teacher caught me i begged not to be sent home i was sent home without delay when my parents found out what i had done i was sent to my room and told to do my homework no one asked why i did it my next serious attempt was in freshman year of high school i had transferred schools hoping that that one change would make my life somehow better it did not once again i was trying to exsanguinate myself i knew i could not do suffocation or choking as i had tried those and my survival instincts were too hard to suppress this time i was sent to the school counselor once i was caught and was then hospitalized shortly before freshman year of university i made my next attempt by poisoning my significant other made abusive comments about my sexuality and i allowed myself to internalize them into a redefinition of my self worth in addition to poisoning i sat in a car in the garage with the engine on hoping to get carbon monoxide poisoning my sister caught me asking what i was doing i lied saying i had lost something in the car and was trying to find it later my significant other asked what was wrong and i admitted that i had swallowed two entire bottles of pain pills once again i was hospitalized i later married her on one hand she says abusive things or did at that time on another hand she saved my life and professed to love me over the next ten years we remained married and between us there has been at least three attempts for one person or another to die i have lost count and it all blends together in my head suffice to say things have not gone smoothly and i know we are not healthy i have had to promise and vow and swear over and over again to other people to not kill myself i feel like i am held captive my life and i want to escape it i am convinced that a change of circumstance such as a different job or a divorce would not change this outlook i am convinced that everywhere i go everyone will still be abusive to each other and prop themselves up by belittling each other making each other miserable i hate life all life is is the unending struggle to stay alive and it always ends with death so why not skip the struggle and just get to the ending edit i am thinking strongly of using a credit card to rent a storage bin big enough for myself and my car parking in it leaving the engine on and the window down and then taking a boatload of pills then i could lie back fall asleep and just never wake up then this whole mess called life would finally be over out of fear of living through it though i could just be extra thorough and simultaneously exsanguinate this is the most difficult part for me so i d likely resort instead to suffocation or ligature compression or make the cut after taking a series of blood thinners so that it is less painful and more successful my main concern is having someone find my body after rescue is impossible but to still be found i guess this is important to me for the sentimental reason that i do not want anyone to think that i just dissapeared or leave them with some belief that i am alive out there somewhere	d
20277	i am drowning i used to think depression was a joke i used to be insensitive and tell people to suck it up now im one of those people spiraling down and people telling me i will be ok and suck it up i am told to see a therapist i do not see any good there i started to cut a few days ago and it seems to be the only thing that relieves the pain i want to die repeated pregnant and done i am 5 months pregnant i am living with my child s father but in a separate room we broke up right after we found out i was pregnant i fell into a deep depression there was an array of emotional abuse i contemplated killing myself for awhile i loved at home with my family but i broke my ties with them after major disagreements living with him is my last resort i crave love and affection i feel so alone i feel my baby kick and i want to end her life debating if i should take hers alone or mine along with her it s only going to get worse i moved out of my city i quit my job i lost my only family i had to get rid if my pet because my ex hates animals and i am living with this jerk i am tired of hysterically crying and my feelings being undermined like i am crazy i am not crazy i am alone in this darkness the bastard says he s not in love with me he told me i was acting crazy and inevitably it pushed him away further i am done i do not want to wake up and see tomorrow i have nothing left this baby has been nothing but a burden i am tired	c
20824	i have fucked up my life and now i am dragging my wife and daughter down with me even my attempts to seek counseling and get medication have ended in failure i feel like i was screwed from the start i was born near detroit my father was a drug dealer and my mom was a drug addict most of my memories of my biological parents involve fighting my biological mom left when i was eight and my stepmom moved in she had all of the bipolar drug addict craziness of my mom without any of the giving a shit about me that came with the previous model my whole life i have had to live as an impostor i was sent to a different school district than the area i grew up in because my dad knew i would get my ass kicked if i went to the local neighborhood school i had to lie about what my dad did for work and where i lived i also had to deal with not being able to join any clubs or participate in events because my family would not pay the fees i graduated in 2007 right before the economy went to shit i wasn t able to find a job so i had to help my dad by living in one of his cheap grow houses in a shitty mostly abandoned neighborhood the only running water went to the basement for the plants so i needed to fill buckets of water and carry them upstairs to have water to cook with clean with and drink about 3 years ago i decided i needed to find a craft and start a career i choose to study systems administration at allcaps itt allcaps tech i was able to complete the program and get an associates but my allcaps gpa allcaps was only 2 9 and i failed a few classes because i was unable to get rides to school or afford bus fare the bus system in detroit is also notoriously bad so i get my degree and my head full of computer knowledge and two years and three helpdesks later i know i do not want to be an it guy anymore but now i have no idea what i want to do i am buried in student loan debt to the tune of 40 000 and my only other plan in life was to be a writer a few of my teachers told me i had talent but my family just said i needed to be more worried about making money and less on stupid bullshit while i was working i met my wife and after about half a year she became pregnant i moved out of my parents house and in with my inlaws while my wife was pregnant my daughter is a year old now and she and my wife are able to provide some comfort but it s only small in the moment stuff nothing can help me with my deeper issues i have completely lost hope that i will ever turn my life around and get to a place where i am happy college was supposed to turn my life around and all i did was pay 40 grand to learn that the helpdesk is a soul sucking nightmare my wife and kid were supposed to turn my life around but the amount of pressure i feel when i think about how hard their lives will be with me i have never really found a place where i fit in or a place i could call home i never felt like i belonged with my family a timid bookworm among grease monkeys and small time thugs i was outcast by the outcasts in high school i never really made friends in college and work is a different monster entirely every helpdesk i have worked on has pushed my stress meter to 11 10 the hectic pace of the work and the constantly reinforced expectations of perfection would have me so stressed out by the end of the day that i would just yell at my family if i talked to them at all hell at one of my jobs i literally could not handle the pressure anymore and just walked out on a job i had been at for over a year i have been unemployed since may and my family has become increasingly frustrated with me i feel like my dreams or dead i can not even write without feeling stupid about it i thought getting a real job would be the key to digging myself out of poverty but now all i am is a working sucker my dad may be broke now but when he was my age he would walk around with over five grand in his wallet cash not only have i not surpassed my father by going straight i have pretty much proved how pointless it actually is i can not wait for this magical point where all of my hard work will finally turn into something that makes me happy anymore when i look at my future all i see is more disappointment and heartache even if i worked full time and in my field i would not be able to take care of my family all i can see is a future of living in bad areas struggling to keep the lights on and explaining to my daughter why she can not afford to go to x or do i am never going to be successful enough to publish a book or explore any part of the world that is not the one i was born in i can not hold a job for more than a year without having some kind of nervous breakdown i live with my wife and my own flesh and blood daughter and i still feel like i do not belong here i feel like i am never going to find anywhere i belong or can be happy i am going to be one of the sad bluecollar people who busts their ass at a job they hate until they are just too dead and empty inside to do anything else the more i look over the landscape of my future the more i do not want it i can not endure that life and i do not want to i do not want to improve myself because i still have to build all of that improvement on a broken pile of shit i wish i could be someone else i wish i could be one of those six figure white kids who went to a real university and goes on vacation every year i wish i would have had a family that would have supported my writing but it s too late now it s too late to do anything someday when i grow up is now here and i have chosen poorly and will spend the rest of my life suffering for it i love my wife and my daughter but i just want to be dead so bad it hurts i have even hoped that my wife would throw me out of the house or take her and leave just so i could feel less bad about leaving them alone i have thought about using one of my father in law s guns to blow my own brains out or walking around in public with a knife so that the cops would have to kill me there used be times when i was driving home from work and i would fantasize about getting in an accident so that i would not have to deal with the struggle anymore i am just so sick of struggling i am so tired of being held back by the same bullshit and always feeling like i am doing something wrong saying something wrong or that there is something wrong with me my family knows about my mental health they say they want to help but nothing ever comes of it so far the closest i have gotten is a treatment center that requires medicaid who cut my services off after i was denied now i am back to square one someday soon i am going to snap and do something irrational everyday i just try to hold it together and distract myself with video games or reading but the thoughts of my disappointing life so far and the disappointment in the future are always there ready to drag me down maybe it will not be tomorrow maybe it will not be till my daughter is 5 or 6 but i feel like a ticking time bomb i am just so lost and scared i was dealt a shitty hand and i played it wrong and now i do not know what i am going to do with myself let alone the wife and daughter who depend on me it s too much	c

29142	doing something i successfully stopped doing years ago drinking my pain away alone in my room i have not had anything to eat today i took adderall and klonopin i will probably take my seroquel and remeron too and my vitamins with the alcohol and i do not even care i do not necessarily want to die repeated i am not feeling suicidal just want everything to go away for awhile but i also kind of do not care if i do die chances are i will end up throwing up everything i have taken along with most of the alcohol based on how much i plan on drinking so i do not think i am in any real danger i just do not care i can elaborate a bit further on why i am feeling this way if anyone cares to talk to me about it but for the sake of someone else s privacy i will not go into too much detail i just noticed now do not be explicit about hope i wasn t too explicit especially since this is not a plan just coping i guess that could will have negative consequences	d
29220	i just got a months worth of zoloft and what should i expect why do so many people here use throwaways	b
29305	suicidal thoughts as a coping mechanism first i just want to say i am not suicidal at least not in any immediate chance of suicide however i do not know where else i can post this a few years ago i was diagnosed with allcaps ptsd allcaps during the severe stages i would stay awake for hours panicking about the collapse of society and chaos it has been treated and now it is more manageable beyond the occasional minor attack however a developed a method of coping with my panic attacks only one that seemed to work completely a lot of my fears and anxiety comes from the lack of control that the future is uncertain and death could come at any time that i could be stuck in some depressing future so i realised that i could just kill myself if things went bad enough and it worked as an idea somehow it gave me back control that if eventually my death will be at my own hands then i do not need to fear anything else i can not find anything about people doing this just wanted to know if i was alone in this	b
29356	i want to end all this pain and suffering january and most of february have been without a doubt the best months of my whole life i got a girlfriend who i care about oh so very much my grades went up and pretty much everything was going good then my mom found out that my girlfriend and i had sex my mother is a very religious woman but i am not she grounded me for 2 months for having sex i had no contact with my girlfriend and life just seemed so dull fast foward to now where my mom installs cameras in my house to make sure i am not with my girlfriend or anyone for that matter this has affected her and i to the point where both of us are cutting almost everynight i have told my mom about it and she told me that if i ever cut or tried to kill myself again she would send me to a mental institution maybe i sound like a spolied brat thats not getting what he wants but i just want the things that make me happy such as seeing my girlfriend hanging out with friends having sex with my girlfriend and just feeling alive again it s just hard when your mother thinks you are something wrong but you know it s right i want to run away and jump off a bridge maybe slit my throat open with a razor just anything to escape from this hell	c

close i have gotten with these people and i am just totally shattered we wont hang out as often if at all since theres no more practice and i just can not go back to being alone my happiness is always fucking temporary and i can not do this anymore i am sad because i was having fun and i think that s all that really kept me from wanting to die for the past month and i am afraid of going back to being alone and sad all the time and i feel shitty because every time i think that maybe things are looking up for me and going to work out and maybe i deserve to be happy something always ends up happening to ruin it and now i am back to being afraid that nobody will ever want to make music with me again and that i will have to be alone again and trying to distract myself from how fucking upset i am and i never found anything that made me so happy before now and now its gone and i am just completely done with even trying i do not fit anywhere anymore and i am so tired of existing i used to feel so special and happy that i finally belonged somewhere and now i m being abandoned again i really am as disposable as everyone thinks i am the group tore itself apart and i don t know what i m supposed to do i wanted so desperately to see the people i loved so much we made plans to visit one another and now everyone hates each other i m so tired of the endless cycle of abandonment i wasn t meant to be here i don t want to live myself in constant fear of being left behind i don t believe anybody who promises me anything anymore you ll all leave it s pointless to promise you ll stay i m a fucking drag to be around and i don t know how to let go of people i don t think anybody listens to me everybody thinks everything i say is an empty threat nobody offers me help and on the rare occasion anyone does it s obvious they don t really care i really want to be dead it wouldn t hurt anyone i ll just be replaced again the same as always i m no ones first choice and i m so sick of not mattering i don t understand other people and i m so sick of existing an angry letter to myself they are right about you you do not matter your friends do not care about you and they always leave you anyway do not get attached you are not worth other people s time you are a burden on those you are close to they should beat you senseless and leave you in a ditch nobody wants somebody who can hardly function because of crippling anxiety you are not worth the time and effort you take up you are a waste of space you are sad all the time and nobody wants to be around you you are complete and total garbage your gender does not exist not in the eyes of anyone in your family at least you are a confused girl nobody cares that you are genderfluid get over it and live with what you have commit to something stop with the fluctuating dysphoria that nobody else seems to deal with you will never have the power to change your body at will no matter how badly you want it you are either going to live with tits or top surgery and you will not be able to switch in between no matter how much you desire it get over it and commit to something be a man or be a woman you disappoint your family with the freak you have grown into you will never meet the standards you have for yourself they are impossible on every level your brother is right you are broken you are a freak you should not be allowed to express your sexuality you know you will never be able to bring a girl home without scrutiny nor find a man you are attracted to who is not either gay or taken if you can not fix it off yourself you should have done it a long time ago your family views you as a blemish your friends are nearly nonexistent you have been alone nearly eighteen years and you will be alone for all the years to come you should have died already and you are a coward for not offing yourself you would save everyone a whole lot of trouble embarrassment and false pity been lonely had a friend over last night she left this morning repeated and i have literally lost all motivation to do anything again we did not sleep much so i fell asleep on the couch again once she left but then couldnt motivate myself to do anything for the rest of the day all i have done today is lay in bed i am just really sad i have not had a friend over in ages before last night and now i am back to being a lonely emotional wreck my dad just told me if you keep posting sad things all over the internet the police will come again and this time they will take you away and my first thought in reaction to that was good because i can not handle living with my psychotic brother who treats me like garbage every chance he gets i do not care that he s 13 and i am almost 18 i am living with an emotionally abusive person i am constantly alone and wishing i was dead i want to die i feel completely empty inside and i hate it my brother treats me like garbage and drives me insane on a daily basis and i can not deal with it he screams at me over the tiniest things and calls me a fat ugly pig and constantly treats me like dirt because of my sexuality and interests i have been looking for a part time job but nowhere seems to want to hire me i have to deal with his shit all day every day and he always screams get a job and then you will not have to deal with it when he knows i am fucking looking my mom s only response is we can not separate you just because you fight all siblings fight even after i told her that if i have to stay with him much longer i will end up killing myself i only have one friend in my state and she lives really far away so we can not hang out as much as i want to i have zero social skills and no way of making friends i have crippling anxiety and every time i try to talk to someone i do not know i panic i am bad with people and i spend all my time in my room by myself i can not drive so i can not go anywhere and i am slowly withering away without any sort of people to spend time with all the friends i have had over the years have tossed me aside and forgotten about me even though i try so hard to be a good friend the only friends i have are over the internet and that s just not the same as having friends in real life i begged my parents to let my best friend come and visit for a week over the summer and my parents said they d think about it and then the summer was over and i did not get to hang out with anybody half of my internet friends do not even like me and i am sure they talk about me and laugh behind my back i am sure i annoy all of them and they would be better off if i went away i did not talk to any of them for a whole month because i was so sure they did not like me and they seemed happy when i came back but i am even more sure they do not like me now i know nobody would miss me if i was gone i am a complete waste of space and obviously do not matter to anybody if all my friends do is throw me away no matter what i do it s been like this my entire life my friends either turn out to be abusive assholes or turn out not to like me in the first place i am not in a relationship but i do not even want one right now all i really want are friends i really can not handle this much longer	c
29665	i am basically homeless i can not afford therapy or medication and i can feel what little is left in my life unraveling i guess when it comes down to it i am not worth helping unless i have money for psychiatrist visits and medication i used to see a doctor and take medicine both cost me about 600 month when i could afford it but my income has been slowly falling repeated now it is 505 month working as an adjunct professor at a community college i have no wife girlfriend or kids indeed i am still a virgin at 44 years ago having given up on any hope of finding someone who would be willing to put up with me family is far away but they never call me i am always the one who has to initiate contact my sister never seems that interested in talking to me and i literally have to beg to speak with my nieces attempts to find more work have all led to disappointment and failure because i am a single male with no kids and a job that is reported to the state as only 4 hours a week i do not qualify for any kind of assistance whatsoever in the state of florida i currently sleep in the building where i used to teach piano lessons craigslist ads for getting students has yielded absolutely zero new students but several attempts to scam me i used to have 75 students i am down to 4 students now and closing the studio down is a real possibility that would just emphasize how much i have failed plus giving me no place but the outside to deal with i tried a kickstarter for a children s book which failed less than 20 people even bothered to back it and i only got 1 2 of the amount i asked for reddit thought it was a horrible book and i guess they were right given that they predicted the kickstarter would fail after the first week i illegally sleep in my piano teaching studio now as i have for several years now trying to put my life back together but everything i do seems to just keep me where i am without any improvement i answered an ad for an online piano teaching job but my internet connection and computer are not fast and powerful enough i d need over 500 in equipment to get started with no guarantee of students i spent this month s rent money on a limo driver s certification hoping to find some work there repeated all of the places here want not only the certification i got but another certification in the neighboring county and they want me to purchase my own allcaps gps allcaps unit with a minimum of 2 chargers smartphone does not count which costs more money which i do not have so i feel like i wasted that money getting the certificate i owe 20 000 in back taxes to the allcaps irs allcaps they have refused offers in compromise twice already the tax lien placed on my name prevents me from getting any sort of credit and has prevented me from qualifying for a lease for a small studio apartment probably a good thing because i would have ultimately been unable to pay the rent and been evicted the temp agency i applied at has not called me once for any positions and calls to the agency are met with a stern we will call you if we are able to match you with something please stop calling us i have gone from eating rice and beans to just rice when i can force it down i have most of the materials needed to end my life i have fantasies of attempting suicide and then getting the help i need because of the attempt then i feel horrible because i should not be abusing anything that way or be that manipulative so i can not just attempt to end my life repeated i have to make sure it succeeds so that no one can accuse me of just wanting attention or being a lazy burden on everyone or being accused of selfishly wanting to hurt everyone it would be weeks before anyone would know if i were able to carry it out tonight students would just think i was sick or on vacation the college would fire me after i missed class twice in a row without letting them know but they d do it through email not by calling or any other method family would just think that i was busy and they d leave voicemail messages if they called at all all i have now is venting to places like and here and i know it s not enough but this is all i have it s all i can afford to do if i were a more worthy person i d be able to afford real treatment which i have since learned is only a mask covering the reality but if one is poor one does not even deserve the mask life and society would objectively be better off without me that last sentence was really egotistical of me 99 9999996 % of the world will not even know or care that i am gone their lives are not made better and only negligibly made worse by me existing i do not even know now why i wrote all of this maybe it s hoping that someone cares or even at least pretends to care for a few moments or maybe it was just me making things more definite and concrete i am not even sure if it matters anymore i am just overwhelmed and have nowhere to turn and maybe i do not deserve to be able to turn anywhere this is the third time in 24 hours i have written something like this repeated i deleted the other two without posting repeated i fell asleep crying while typing this last night i can not keep living like this but every attempt to make a difference has ultimately failed or backfired i am scared to do or try anything else all anyone can do to help me is talk and the time for talking s over it just prolongs the inevitable allcaps edit allcaps i am still here mainly because i barely have the willpower to get up let alone do something meaningful i lay on a walmart army style cot alternating between typing and crying and sleeping and waking up from some old time radio dragnet episodes i have on another computer and which i just have not gotten around to turning off i was told to remove some sentences where i talked about how i would end my life i finally got around to doing that and i am sorry for all the disruption i have caused everyone has been too kind with their responses to me they say that sometimes writing a note is cathartic i thought about writing his heiligenstadt testament and how it was obviously cathartic for him as he considered suicide because he was losing his hearing but in the middle of the note he seems to have a change of heart i have been very depressed for the last few days weeks months years and decided to try to write something like that only it did not come out as cathartic for me the only thing that provided any relief from the pain i feel was a calmness that came from a realization that if i went through with this i would be completely free from pain i d be free from all other emotions too obviously but at this time that seems to be a reasonable trade i do not have the preferred means to end my life so it probably is not an emergency and i probably should not be posting here i can share the note but it s very long too long for this text entry	c
29738	i have a friend who i feel is spiraling and he may snap sometime this week sorry for the wall of text but i need some opinionsthis story is of my friend i am concerned about his former best friend the boyfriend and the girl at the center the girlfriend so i have a friend of mine who has been in love with his best friend s girlfriend for two and a half years she does not return the favor and has kept him around because they are friends and she does not want to hurt his feelings now i know that he thinks she was stolen from him by his best friend nowadays he is the most depressed i have ever seen he does not talk much and he does not really hang out with anyone anymore as far as i can tell he smokes a lot of weed and hangs out in his room most of the time he has become on edge and allcaps very allcaps confrontational to the point that i am worrying about the safety of several people whenever he does hang out with people he just sits around everyone silently watching them he posted on facebook today a status about a tarot card reading he may have actually had i do not know that consisted of death bad and unhappy bad i am worried that the only thing that is keeping him from snapping is his hope that he may end up getting with this girl but her boyfriend has had enough and is trying to get his girlfriend to write a note that basically says i do not love you he will probably get this note sometime this week i have read some symptom threads online and everything i have read seems to reinforce my thoughts that he may be suicidal to sum up i have a friend who s been obsessed with his best friend s girlfriend for two and a half years and blames him for stealing him from her he has slowly spiraled downward and now i fear for the safety of all three of them especially since he is going to get a letter that says the love of his life does not love him sometime this week allcaps edit allcaps clarity and grammar	a
29972	i am useless im an idiot i have no redeeming qualities i cant socialize with people and i try to make myself feel useful by making up traits about myself and wearing a mask when im with people in public i try to come off as funny or interesting but im a boring piece of shit with no interests or passions that i could ever live up to or dedicate myself to long enough to even come close to getting better at them im not smart im not attractive im not sociable im not athletic im nothing i just try to make jokes and create interesting stories but even those suck i used to be smart or atleast feel like it i cant construct normal thoughts and my vocabulary is limited im not talented like any of the kids i see at school i have no specialty no hobbies im just a mess who tries to catch up but never will im an edgy idiot with a small brain and ik its true i spend hours studying things people grasp in minutes then get distracted for a few hours more repeated i think i have potential somewhere but i dont actually not even an adhd pill helped me focus because im so fucking stupid i cant form normal thoughts im always sidetracked i think that maybe i have some potential or im a smart person just that i cant express it or i cant focus and tap into that intelligence but that will never happen because nothing has helped me do so i cant be a fucking artist or a writer because even my handwritings too shit to express thoughts on paper let alone draw im going to be zoning out and thinking of philosophies and concepts of life for the rest of mine but i will never be able to hold a normal conversation with anyone for too long because i dont know how to express myself or how to utilize my thoughts or thinking abilities i try and make myself feel better by acting like i have an idea of whats going on and i have some redeeming qualities or that im someone whos different in a good way instead of a fucking ball of anxiety distraction insecurity and endless self construed facades aimed at myself and others alike i think i have a mental disorder or that theres something wrong with me theres nothing wrong with me theres no excuse for my stupidity my laziness and inability to grasp simple concepts i act like i like the people around me like i understand them and like they understand me everytime someone finally gets close to me my relationship with them is bound to end in a shitty way because i cant help but act out because im too irresponsable to keep a long term relationship i think im something different or someone who matters im slow as hell and cant construct simple thoughts and do simple things or pick up on social cues and not be a rude fuck i think that maybe im a nice person or maybe finally find whatever im good at or finally settle down with someone who likes me or finally meet someone who seems like me but i cant express anything im just a stupid piece of shit who wishes he had some value or some importance i piss off anyone i get too close to or i burden the people im close to because im an over flowing shit hole of problems that needs to dump itself on other people to feel fine i try to think that others like me or can actually manage to enjoy my obnoxious company i think that i have a future in writing films or making music but im never going to live up to any of the expectations i set for myself im just going to keep failing over and over again or i could settle for less and live my entire life wishing to be living on the greener grass and after i write this memo im gon na go back to that life of bullshit where i act like im not a complete retard or like i can think and function normally and talk to people normally i think i might stop snapping out in anger or im not an edgy fuck i think i might even be nice but in reality im just a selfish prick who only cares for himself and cant try to grasp the concept that the world doesnt revolve around him i think that im the main character in my movie but in reality probably just stay a cameo or the villain everyone wants to see die i do stupid things and i think loathful thoughts when i get angry out of the blue and afterwards the only things i can do are wonder what the fuck is wrong with me and that i wish someone understood me and knew that i hadnt snapped out because im an evil person just that i snapped out because im a fucking idiot who has no self control or will power then go back to my normal life im gon na keep saying im fine everyday and i will be fine because im only introspective enough to see how useless i am once every few days cry my heart out ask for support then wipe my tears and put my mask back on then repeat the cycle and eventually whoever i cry to will get sick of me and eventually run out of people to cry to im a fucking trap of negativity that draws everyone around me into it and theres nothing more to it and i have so many god damn masks that fit so well on me i can be any personality or mood i want to be and i can do it so perfectly that i feel that mood i emulate acts in my brain programs where i say to myself to start acting one way or another to acclimate to my setting and my surroundings and i feel happy for a bit but ik that the happiness is just an illusion and a facade because when that happiness leaves the anxiety depression and my racing mind all come back and thats the only thing im good at faking myself out and at that point i dont even know who or what my real self is i just have a bunch of personalities i think that my real self would be the ambitious one that thinks he can go to a good college and be a smart balanced healthy kid that somewhere along the timeline or template of actions im in something will change and finally be able to relate to and socialize on the same level with more than just two people that maybe stop being able to analyze every detail around me and stop knowing what details and things are inevitable and stop running processes in my head like a fucking computer to talk to people or guess their thoughts and feelings that maybe finally be able to stop the racing thoughts and channel my intelligence onto something more current finally be able to be good enough for the good people around me who watch out for me and care for me regardless of the dead weight i am finally amount to more than just an undiagnosed piece of shit that was the result of a condom rupture and i wont be that kid whos a weird as fuck nutcase	b

16079	i need advice ok here goes repeated i am 20 years old i have been diagnosed with type two bipolar disorder a few weeks ago i am on medication but nothing seems to be working i am stuck in a hole where nothing is going to get better so honestly what is the point of continuing on every day just to i have suicidal thoughts daily and they just seem to be getting louder and louder repeated	c
16366	last night i caught myself researching suicide methods i am not suicidal i do not have any plans to ever take my own life but i find the suicide methods of some people somewhat poetic for example was a fan of so he bit into a poison laced apple it s tragic that he killed himself but in a sense i also found it beautiful and the fact that i have this opinion makes me absolutely terrified lately i have felt so lonely and watching a couple of friends dropping me to do something else makes me wish the people close to me could value me as much as if i passed away i feel like the only reason why i have not considered actually killing myself is because i am a selfish asshole who wants to experience how it feels to be valued but finding suicide tragically beautiful and researching suicide methods even out of curiosity is so dangerous and i am agonizingly afraid that one day i might tip over and start planning my own death nbsp for the record i did not find a method that i liked all the means of suicide i found were either not symbolic enough for my situation or too slow or painful for me to be satisfied with and i hope that i never find something i like because if i end up giving up on life i will be so much closer to death if i know how i want to go nbsp as a side note i should have probably used a throwaway to post this but a big part of me is hoping someone will stumble upon this thread and a few of the past ten of my threads while going through my profile and let other people know because i have no guts to tell anyone directly	c
16466	tis the season for suicide i wasn t sure where to put this i am guessing this sub reddit is the best one out of all of them i just got off the phone with a co worker there is a company we use for some third party work we need done the company is just one guy this guy we will call him well my co worker just told me he passed away he took his own life needless to say i am seriously bummed out i mean i wasn t best friends with we had a working relationship but still it s repeated shocking one day they are here then you get a phone call it s just surreal i guess what i am here to say is that yea this holiday season can be brutal for some people i understand that well i do not have much in the way of family and you really notice how alone you are when everyone else is talking about how they got this for their wife their parents their kids their brothers and nephews and nieces and all their plans and then they ask what are allcaps you allcaps doing for the holidays and you say i dunno i am very lucky to have some good friends this year i will be spending christmas day with my friend and his family when they get home from church in my rambling way i guess i am saying that if you open your home to someone who has nowhere else to go this season you might be doing a whole lot of good maybe more than you will even know so yea	a
16596	i got nothing repeated i have gone to multiple therapists i have read well over 30 books from actual psychology therapist books finished a good one few weeks ago about behavioral activation about how to treat patients to self help books and philosophy books about happiness such as stoicism i exercise daily last week wednesday i walked 10 miles today at least 5 i do not drink zero alcohol in over 60 days i do not do drugs other than caffeine once in awhile or something for headaches i have not masturbated in over 60 days something i read said some people get addicted to porn masturbation orgasm and this leads to problems with dopamine to over simplify i have done lots of physical and social things such as martial arts 2 years swing dance 2 5 years chess tournaments running 6 miles hanging out with friends dating websites repeated i spent the past 10 years wanting to not be alive while i was seeing therapists i tried to kill myself i said therapists because the first was not helping despite me telling him that i was going to kill myself and how i was going to kill myself the second i was preparing buying stuff and practicing and the second also did not take me seriously again despite me stating exactly what i was going to do i have seen other therapists besides those 2 none of them take me seriously the attempt was approximately 2 years ago so i decided since nobody else gives a rats ass about me despite paying them thousands of dollars that i might as well keep my thousands of dollars repeated i thought maybe the problem was my work made me hate my life i knew that i started thinking about killing myself while still in high school but maybe the attempt was due to the job just made everything worse i was an electrical engineer working on a 1 billion project which literally would not have gotten done on schedule and would have had many more problems had i not been on it last i heard that project has generated well over 9 billion in revenue and the client my company was doing work for which has only ever complained about everyone else had mentioned me by name multiple times as doing a great job i did try to get a job as an electrical engineer for the past 1 year i was told repeatedly from potential employers and recruiters that nobody is going to hire me to do anything other than what i was doing which is out of the question but i figured that since i did try to kill myself that i had to get out i am about to start a programming bootcamp i have done programming i liked programming nobody is going to hire me right now to do programming this particular training has a 94 % employment rate with a higher average starting salary than i was making at the job i hated so now here i am about to begin a career change by learning programming from professionals i can only think about how i want to die and seriously am considering trying again repeated is the thought process from the anxiety of the programming training in part yes last week the week i walked 10 miles on wednesday on both thursday and friday i walked at least 6 miles each and other than that i spent the day in bed unable to move from depression i can afford the bootcamp living expenses apartment food etc and i have a few extra months of expenses saved up in case i do not get a job right after the training ends i can not emphasis afford to waste more money on a bunch of insert text therapists who ignore the fact that i am literally in the process of killing myself and provide no support so what the fuck am i supposed to do now that i want to die i have wanted to die for more than a third of my life nobody i pay takes me seriously and i can not afford to pay them right now anyway and i really need to be able to actually think because i am going to spend the next 3 months learning a new career and being depressed is not a good thing to be while learning a new career path and networking and going on interviews repeated is this continuous 25 year old been thinking about killing myself for more than 10 years i have sought therapists and psychologists multiple times and have been told you do not seem like you are depressed this is despite telling them in detail how i was going to kill myself along with actually following through with the plan after thinking about it and practicing for several weeks before the attempt to become more comfortable with the process for better or worse about halfway through my unconscious overpowered me and i stopped the process there have also been way too many attempts of me trying to fix myself with exercise self help stuff meditation blah blah blah my question for anyone who goes through this is this a continual urge for you or does it come and go i ask because i recently told a friend about this and the friend said that it is usually a constant thing for me i never want to live and given the choice i would normally take a death while i sleep almost any day of the week but the actual urge to actively kill myself is not constant for me there is a continual desire to be dead there is not a continual desire to kill myself and there is always a fear of dying	c
16673	one day at a time repeated you know how people often tell you to live one day at a time i think i really know what that means a lot of people around me are so afraid of dying pain and the unknown there are many times that i have felt that i was truly at the end of my rope what stops me from ending it all is not the fear of death or pain or any of that what stops me is my fear of making a wrong or stupid decision you know when people play rpg games and the unspoken strategy is to look in all the dead end rooms before moving on just in case there are good items i am scared that i might miss something everyone says live one day at a time too often i have found myself thinking that this is the last day or this is the last week or this is the last month often afterwards i d think that i should have been dead long ago or that i am wasting time so i no longer have the same fears that most people have to me things just happen if i were to die tomorrow then i d simply just die tomorrow in reality i am already hollow on the inside so here we go again let us call it one month at a time my deadline is one month either my willpower and personal abilities change everything in my life or i guess i really have been just wasting time	c
16852	my life is a waste i feel useless like shit i fail all the time i am not good at anything only my english is somehow medium and it s still bad my grades are low they are enough only to pass a school year i can not find myself in any subject can not think what would i do in the future if i can make it repeated my parents seem to be fighting all the time beside i do not want to talk with them about my problems i do nothing but browsing the internet and playing video games i do not go to any parties my excuse always is that i do not go where i am not invited but repeated i do not even know how to find parties and i am not invited to anything repeated i am not bullied at school i am just a regular guy nobody cares of me if i stand watching the floor or sit somewhere cuddling myself close to a window no one sees me and i have tried to pick up any girl in 2 last years i have got dumped repeated 7 times so far 3 of them i cared the most and they just make me more sad as i think of them anytime repeated every time there is some one better than me every single time first one dumped me for a douchebag that was a complete asshole for everyone i know he has met repeated second one dumped me for another douchebag this one was very special she was in a relationship a few months ago i started to talk with her they broke up becaue of some reason i do not know anyway after that she had a touch from her friend that the douche got a gf really fast and that he was cheating her with another 3 ones she did not seem to care about that they came back together and she left me totally they broke up after a week the second one had more specifies but repeated i do not know how to describe it better all i know she s again in a relationship with another dude repeated third situation is very fresh it happened a week ago repeated yeah it s all because the fucking new year s eve i am going to hate it for the rest of my probably fucking short life everything was fucking great as it always is at start of my contacts but it s a ruin now she got drunk and met a guy on a party that i could not go she had sex with him now i am dumped again repeated so summing it up i am a loser in my eyes i am not too smart i am not too cool nobody loves me beside parents but i do not even know if they still do nobody gives a fuck about me from time to time i am getting a knife into my room and i hold it right where my heart is i think the only reason i have not killed myself yet is because i am scared if it could hurt or if i somehow miss my hit repeated i tried to shoot some things with an air gun with steel bullets but i am not sure if it would kill me with one shot in the head or just hurt me repeated i am praying all the time if i can find a gun so i can shoot myself properly repeated if i find one i am just gon na take it and fire without any warning to anybody repeated still there are missing a few things but i do not know how to describe them repeated i am like if somebody tells me to kill myself i will try it with a knife	d
16867	why i want to die i have not wanted to die in so long but lately the urge is so strong i do not know what to do i am mainly depressed because of past mistakes haunting me i got banned from a and consequently banned from another website because a user recognized me and then dissed me for it i just i feel so alone and want to die i have already attempted suicide by drinking bleach perhaps i did not drink enough either way i will propbably go through with it eventually up and down we go where the merry go round ends no one knows i have been suffering depression since i was in 5 th grade elementary 9 10 years old the first time i told my parents i wanted to kill myself was in 5 th grade they casually laughed and brushed it off saying you are too young to know what that entails going through middle school junior high 12 14 years i got worse i was able to function and achieved high grades as well as excellent remarks from my teachers but it wasn t enough there was always the constant thought of what if i just killed myself back then i was being threatened by this man that he would kill my family members in the most gruesome ways possible the police became involved after i sent an email of panick to some government website saying i was suicidal and whatnot that day my parents finally took my depression and suicidality seriously a few weeks later i was ordered by the police to join therapy my parents complied entering high school 14 17 years things got even worse emphasis i got my first boyfriend during my freshman year except he was a senior i did not know it at the time but everyone thought i was a slut for that i became labeled as a gold digger easy slut whore etc solely because i dated a senior during my freshman do year in high i found all of this out later in my sophmore year when the whispers would not stop the snickers would be shot my way with menacing glares and the isolation began i was no longer with my senior boyfriend but as high school works once you are labeled you might as well brand it on your forehead i moved onto my second boyfriend a whom later raped me at my own home i was strangled and often verbally abused by him after i broke up with him he continued to spread rumors about me at school often exploiting that we had sex and i am his main prostitute i soon began to go to school everyday carrying a scissor in my backpack in almost every class i d cut myself as i cried silently none of this made me feel better eventually i went to my counselors and asked to check myself into a mental ward this experience just worsened me finally i decided to leave that high school and become home schooled basically i only go to an affiliated high school once a week for one hour i no longer want to cut myself and for the past four or five months i have been as stable as i can be however lately i have been feeling extremely down due to family members and an issue that arised here on reddit which i will not discuss i am at the point where i do not really eat drink and sleep too much life brings me no joy and i feel as if i can never become truly happy now i have an itch on my wrist that seems to scream encouragements for a blade my parents have grounded me for 6 months which does not end till august during that time period i am not allowed to see my friends i only have 2 which is not a big deal allcaps but allcaps as it is i do not go to school anymore the school i go to once a week make sure you never see any other kids and i am stuck at home or at my aunts house all day except for that one hour monday sunday i feel isolated alone lonely and frustrated because i can not get away from my family my depression and my past i am taking antidepressant and have been professionally diagnosed with major chronic depressive disorder i just turned 17 this month tl dr i am a mess and deserve to die	d
17336	i am not suicidal but i need some help and i am not desperate enough to seek professional help i am sorry if this does not belong here it s not exactly suicide related but perhaps adjacent i am 24 and i have never been under the influence of any substance outside of painkillers i was prescribed i have a very addictive personality and most of the time i do not want to leave sobriety for any reason due to personal reasons lately my life has been getting more and more stressful and i have always been very anti suicide like just mortified of death but lately i just get these brief thoughts of how relieving it would be i assure you it could not be further from a possibility right now i am not considering it however repeated in those moments alcohol becomes very tempting i am worried that one day i will rationalize trying it and i will overdo it like i overdo everything new and exciting and i will fall into a deep hole of alcoholism which runs deep in my family my question is repeated what should i do should i tell someone should i try to introduce myself to alcohol slowly so it stops becoming this time bomb that i feel it has become should i just keep up with my willpower and ignore the temptations what should i do this is a very low pressure post by the way i am not like repeated shaking with a bottle of whisky in my hand i just finally felt like it was time to get this off my chest if you d like to refer me to another that s fine too	b

8416	can not sleep past will eat me hello hope this is the right place it s about 3 30 here given up on waking at 7 00 this morning to go to the clinic so going to write here i grew up in arizona wasn t born there i was born in montreal qc canada where i am now but i lived over 12 years there my stepfather was abusive only to me because my mother had told him at the start that if he hit her she would divorce him and because my sister was too pure i suppose i have a few memories that pop up from time to time lots of stuff from my sister though as the experience made me repress most of my childhood repeated i do not remember anything before i was 13 in any coherency i do not know any of my old teachers for example anyways not really the point as what s going wrong started around the time that i can remember when i was 13 i had been trying to get a girlfriend for a long time probably to be cool or such who knows i had talked with girls a bit most did not like me too much i was passingly curious about homosexual activities but my thoughts were on girls i found out that there was a guy who was gay gasp at my school and i eventually talked to him i asked him about all sorts of stuff curiosity coming out and well i mentioned my parents were not home and that was my first sexual experience i later found out that he was essentially the ringleader of the gays in my school being the only non closeted i had a few more encounters with him few because he was not attracted to me and would insult me before during and after the experience which wasn t fun he set me up with some of the other closeted guys repeated 4 in total i think and i had experiences with them as well that s how i started being the school slut fast forward three years and i had been fucked by 10 other guys i d never top for various reasons i had some relationships during that time but not very strong ones as i was a slut first and foremost recently january 2012 i eventually fell in love with someone i had known for over a year and another person i had known for the same time at the same time they did not know each other i loved them both and did not know which to pursue i tried for both about july 2012 i let it break that i loved them both had them talk and after tears and fighting we entered a sort of three way relationship by this point i was aware that my past might hurt them so i told them that i hated anal so i would not endanger them too much they brought my total to 12 more recently 3 weeks ago one eventually had me make a choice between them i chose one over the other tried to help the one who was not chosen talking to him lots ect ect i have remained on pretty good terms with him he wants to re enter obviously that s a problem and all but lots of stress for everyone around also recently january 2013 moved back to montreal to live with my father and go to university here concordia i got my health card about a week ago and booked an appointment with my school s clinic free healthcare and whatnot told them what i needed did the urine test was supposed to do the blood test tomorrow but as stated can not sleep so will probably do it saturday that s the one i am afraid of because there is a damn high chance i have allcaps hiv allcaps in me and do not know it yet especially because of my first encounter as that guy had fucked every closeted gay in school which was dozens i will be getting the results on the 1 3 th i believe i take the subway home repeated but i promised the one i did not choose that i would not do anything the day i find out to at least talk to them beforehand and give closure repeated he says it s to convince me otherwise but repeated anyways if that test comes back positive i know i will be emotionally wrecked repeated well more than that my life is gone there s no telling when it d develop to allcaps aids allcaps and kill me painfully repeated i d likely drop out of school just repeated sigh emphasis hello i have attempted suicide before due to my stepfather s abuse and all that repeated failed attempts but real ones and i think this would be worse than anything he could have done so repeated after thinking things over i guess i really do not want to die i know i will if it comes back positive i will want it with a passion but i do not now and that s why i am here because i do not want to hurt the people i love and i do not know if i can stop it thanks sorry for the long post	c

saved up money for recording equipment and have recorded a couple local bands but i do write music as well i smoke cannabis it helps me stay grounded for the reason i believe to be that it makes me oblivious to my emotions i have been jaded for many years but have come to the conclusion that i want to end my life hi to anyone who stops by and hears my sorry for the do not remember the first time i thought of killing myself but i do remember that my earliest thoughts never involved doing it any time soon i have always had the commitment that i would not want to live much pass 50 i am currently 18 and in most circumstances thinking about my own death i knew unless of an accident prior i would want to put myself out this has always been the way i thought of my own death since i lost my cousin who was 17 at the time to a car accident in late 2008 the first time i really thought about my own mortality i have been on a steady decline depression wise since then although i do not really believe that the accident was what triggered it i am now seeing my classmates send off to university as i am stuck at home without my high school diploma because i have failed 3 classes in the last year my parents could not be more disappointed and their disappointment is really the only reason why i am going back to school for the 3 credits you see my parents also play a key role in why at first i did not want to kill myself i have always been told suicide is a selfish act it s what you hear on the news and in classrooms that individuals that kill themselves are only thinking about themselves that is why i always figured maybe i will wait for my parents to go before i do but now i am thinking maybe not i have kept the same job for a couple years now starting as a busboy in october of 2013 at a local pub restaurant i have met some really great people there who have helped boost my confidence socially and personally i feel more relaxed at work then at school and i think i act more myself around my co workers than my friends not to say i do not relate to my friends but i am really not as close with my pals as i used to be i have started forcing jokes that fall flat and although have recently put extra effort into finding time to be with them the time spent is awkward and unpleasant i still want all my friends to be a part of my life but i have not felt connected to the clique in a long time i found this following my discovery of the deadredditors sub reddit the first thought popping into my mind being maybe i d be on there soon that s when it kind of clicked i am suicidal i have been for years sure i am also depressed of which i have been medically proven to be but what i have been feeling since the earliest thoughts of my own mortality is the apathy of life the indifference for destiny and a whole lot of self hatred i used to self harm when i was maybe 14 or 15 only one friend knew about it my closest friend at the time who also self harmed i would not consider myself emo i got over that phase a long time ago i think i just kind of did it to assure myself of my loathing but there was really no question about it that i hated myself which is why i stopped i have since lost this friend somewhat he currently in an abusive relationship with a girl that tried to claim i sexually assaulted her which i did not he s now just looking for an answer to breaking up with her but knows if he does it for the plain sake of not liking her as a human being she will threaten to kill herself it s twisted because he s knows what it feels like to have someone in his life try to kill themselves because i remember him telling me one time about how he had just received a text from a friend who was in the hospital after attempting suicide at this point it now sounds like i live in some town full of kids trying to kill themselves which is not really true in fact of the thousands of kids who live in this town these are really the only major cases i know of right now as i am almost breaking 4000 characters i realize what i am saying is not even really the thick of it re reading the text did not feel the same as typing it which is weird re reading it felt a lot more disconnected emotionally i am not sure why i am mentioning this but i will now continue so why do i now feel like how early i go will not change a thing well mathematically doing it earlier will give more time for anyone who cares to heal but also i realized rethinking my cousin s death that humans are a lot more prone to accepting tragedies than we really think it was devastating waking up at 3 am to my mother on the phone crying then sitting on my bed clutching her arms around me as she shared what had happened but to the same effect if i were to go now or ten years from now everything i did in my time here my consciousness and my future would be wiped away just the same so the reason why i am even waiting i can not figure out i have already mentioned that i have to go back to school although i hate it and that my close friendships seem to be unrecoverable my entire life i have consistently embarrassed and resented myself i do not think i am looking for an answer for not killing myself i just can not think of why i should not at this time the answer it does get better feels really pathetic i have no desire to go to any kind of post secondary education even after i get my diploma and i will just end up being a deadbeat until i die anyways	c

51787	just want to be happy someday i have had probably one of the worst lives i have typed it out here plenty of times so if you are curious just look through my post history i want to be truly happy for days at a time like everyone else is why do i have so many mental problems i do not fit in with anybody i am fucking alone every single day of my life parents are kicking me out of the house and i am in complete panic i am going to be homeless where the fuck do i get insulin where the fuck do i sleep where the fuck do i eat why do i do so fucking horrible at school i am in special education everyone fucking makes fun of me or does not want to be my friend in the last few weeks i feel like i am going insane i will not go into details because i have read of people s ip addresses being logged on reddit and being found by others but i want to hurt people i feel no empathy with others i am not even kidding when i say the only person i can relate with is is not that fucking bad i seriously feel completely different from any kid i am out of energy to do this shit fuck everything i am so exhausted all day every day and sorry but i do not really feel like talking on pms or something just comments please i am going to kill myself over the next few years in a way that is accepted by society i want someone to kill me just browse my post history go to my very first post my life is fucking horrible i want to die i might not do it for a while maybe in like 3 5 years depending on how life is going	c
51870	inside joke 20 y o no job no idea of what to do with my future wanted to be major in social work but i can not help people when i am a wreck nothing else even remotely interests me diagnosed major depressive disorder and only recently put on list for psychological evaluation because there s reason to believe i might have a borderline personality disorder being diagnosed would be equally terrifying as being not since it is not treatable either way and as if killing myself tomorrow would be different than dying of natural causes when i am eighty there s nothing to gain no reason to live life is an inside joke that i am not in on all i want is to be forgotten	c
36117	what logical reason is there against suicide lately i have been feeling really awful i feel as if all my friends have abandoned me they say they have not but saying things does nothing without acting on those words basically i feel like every reason i can come up with against suicide can be countered with but it does not matter because i am dead once a person is dead no potential good things will ever change anything it ll hurt my family what do i care i am dead right past that point there s no remorse what reasoning is there against suicide i want to find one i really do but staying alive just does not seem to matter especially from an existential nihilist point of view what s the point of anything i have always had the mind of a scientist thus i simply can not subscribe to any religious explanations all i am is a bundle of atoms all you are is a bundle of atoms we are flying on the earth walking around doing whatever it is we need to do to keep walking around it just all seems so pointless to me anything i try to do to be happy is irrelevant what does one tiny organism s mood matter at all this sort of thinking is just really hitting hard on me right now and i need some motivation i am not thinking of suicide i just do not see the point in working hard or anything like that i am tempted to just quit everything	c
36320	i am sick and tired of being treated like a slave i am living with my best friend and her young son because neither of my parents will take me in right now i am unemployed my best friend cut a deal with me that i d clean and do everything around the house right now i have been doing my best to keep up my end of the deal but my best friend still screams at me if i have not cleaned enough i have been more depressed lately so i have not been cleaning as much as i used to my best friend also has no respect for my things her young son who has some serious behavioral issues took one of my things without asking me and she let him have it also without asking me i feel like she does not respect me at all and will not listen to me if i try to explain myself it seems like nobody wants to hire me i am stuck and do not know where else to go	b
36361	suicide is cheaper than therapy i have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for the last four years started in high school around sophomore year i think i do not know why it started i used to be this incredibly smart kid i was way beyond my peers in first grade in almost every academic sense and i was way more mature than kids my age my parents were good to me i loved my two little sisters and older brother and things were fine then one day i just wasn t able to summon the motivation to do things anymore i developed a flippant attitude towards my future and my grades plummeted my mom looked through my phone one day and saw i was sending suicidal text messages to my now ex boyfriend so she freaked and immediately sent me to a therapist the therapist helped some eventually i dropped out of high school got my allcaps ged allcaps and immediately moved two hours away to study programming at a college there i never finished i could not learn it s like i had a wall in my mind that prevented me from learning anything this was extremely discouraging since i desperately wanted to learn but could not summon the motivation to do much i turned in assignments late or not at all eventually i stopped going to classes altogether each semester i d steel myself tell myself i would do better this time i d successfully go to class every day for a few weeks stay on top of my homework then i d start to slip again i tried to use the school s counseling and grief center but was told i d have to wait at least three months to see someone so i did not bother it felt pointless at this point i was living on my own and working a full time job going to only a few classes each semester eventually i gave up on college altogether and dropped out i would spend days curled up in my basement apartment in bed crying and sleeping and sitting around the house staring at the wall and feeling hopeless and alone fast forward three years i moved to another state because montana is a terrible place for the artistically or technologically inclined i have come close to attempting suicide three different times at the beginning of this year i work full time and still live alone i have enough money to pay my bills but no extra money to set aside i have not bought actual groceries for myself since i moved here i just get a few small things here and there or eat the samples at the wholesale warehouse i work at i was in a relationship with a wonderful guy for a year after i moved here and he proposed to me and i said yes i ended up ending things after doing some hard thinking and realizing that certain issues we had were not going to magically be resolved by marrying each other this is what set off the latest bout of suicidal thoughts i know leaving him was the best thing to do for myself but it s been so hard i have wanted to get help for a long time but i just can not afford it my bank account is usually empty the state will not allow me to have health care welfare or food stamps because i have no children i will not be able to get health insurance from my job until next july this has been affecting my second job severely i have always been an artist ever since i was a child i draw characters and design book covers for people online i used to love drawing and i used to do it every single day now i dread it and can not seem to dredge up the motivation or the ideas to do it very much anymore i still have a list of people that are waiting on me to finish what they paid for i need to do more commissions so i can have that extra money i need but it s been essentially impossible lately the only thing that has seemed to help recently is getting stoned on the weekends when i get stoned i draw like crazy i can not stop i want to draw all the ideas that come flooding out of my head and i want to finish them all i have motivation i have creativity and i can forget all the things that bother me i want to be an animator or character design artist for disney or pixar one day i feel like there is no one i can reach out to about this i am scared to tell my family members because i am worried that they will freak out and call the cops or something i only have one friend who lives back in montana she s my best friend and art buddy and i miss her every single day i miss drawing with her all the time we talk on the phone frequently but i have never told her that i am suicidal i do not want to scare her or freak her out i have never been good at socializing or making friends and lately i just want to be alone and not talk to anyone the only thing that s really kept me from killing myself yet is my two cats i have had them since they were both two weeks old and i adore them i can not imagine what would happen to them if i was gone there have been plenty of times where i gave up food for myself so they could eat instead my uncle committed suicide when i was 6 or so and i remember coming into the kitchen and my dad was leaning on the counter bawling his eyes out my dad is normally very stoic and quiet and i do not want to imagine him breaking down again like that when he gets the news that i am dead yet none of this makes me change my mind or feel better i have been on reddit for quite a while today browsing the threads about parents who have found their children that committed suicide or people who have been wanting to commit suicide and still i can not shake this i want to get help so badly but i can not afford it and i do not know what to do talking about it will help for a few weeks maybe a couple of months and i will feel great and be happy but then the suicidal thoughts always come back always i hate being so miserable like this i want to be happy but i do not know what to do i wonder if i need medication that maybe something is really really wrong with me i wonder how i will pay for medication if i end up needing it my family was always poor poor enough that if you got a cut that needed stitches you put super glue and a band aid on that shit i have not gone to a doctor in years i was always able to tell myself that i did not allcaps need allcaps it that i could deal with whatever was ailing me on my own and that i did not have enough money anyway i think about suicide so often that it s become a habit and i think about it even when i am perfectly happy and everything is going fine i have been obsessing over it a lot lately i hide in the bathroom at work and cry silently and think about swallowing all the pills in my bathroom or driving my car off the side of the freeway cliffs or jumping in front of a bus i do not want to be like this but i feel like suicide is the only way i can end all this life feels so pointless i feel like i will always be poor and struggling with money and my art and my future tl allcaps dr i allcaps ve been suicidal for four years and want to get help but can not afford it suicidal thoughts are becoming more frequent and intense sorry if this did not make sense or if i rambled too much i am crying my eyes out and i am not really thinking too clearly at the moment	c
37414	allcaps fml allcaps shit i am so fucking tiredi have allcaps ocd allcaps bi polar and anxietyi have no real friends people like me for my money i dont think anybody really cares about me i have really bad grades 2 97 gpa 1680 sat 26 act im afraid im gon na end up failing in lifeim socially awkward ive never smoked or drank and im a virgin im 17 going into senior year at high school and im awkward around girls i fucking hate myself for being so goddamn weird allcaps fml allcaps	b
37457	besides thoughts of suicide i really need advice on what to do about my current situation thanks it seems the longer i live the more sad life becomes i was diagnosed with allcaps ptsd allcaps and major depression a couple of years ago stemming from a very rough childhood along with more incidents in my earlier adult years i also have no family to speak of everyone that i thought cared about me turned out to be drug addicts who never had my best intentions in the first place i have gotten help from a therapist and psychiatrist lately but it does not seem to be helping anything i am too old to qualify for a lot of things repeated i do not have healthcare work a dead end job at wal mart and my only friend struggles with mental illness leaving me feel like i am burdening said friend when i reach out for help i moved here to fl a couple years back after a stint of trying to care for my brothers in louisiana we had all been in foster homes i lucked out and was able to become independent quite early my brothers however went through various mental institutions and were subjected to massive amount of abuse meanwhile our was up in colorado somewhere doing her thing doing meth and telling me that everything that happened to the family was my fault i have not talked to her for about a decade since then so i was living in louisiana with my own apartment and a stable job and decided that my brothers should not end up being screwed over by the foster care system keep in mind they both have significant mental illnesses but i had also not physically seen nor talked to them for many years they kept us 100 % isolated from each other during foster care i figured i was strong and stable enough to try to fix the situation and invited them over to live with me after numerous talks with them on the phone and the case counselors i paid for their bus tickets and they came in the summer of 09 at first things went well we did a lot of crying and hugging and talking about everything that had happened to us over the years i also had to convince them that what happened was not my fault in any way our mother had convinced them that the family was torn apart by me somehow probably from the night i called the police when she was jacked on meth and pointing a loaded shotgun at us i was 14 at the time slowly over time their trauma started to surface and signs started to slowly show towards me passive aggressive behavior waking up in the middle of the night to find one of them standing over me with a knife i got them professional help but it wasn t enough the situation devolved into them becoming totally unmanageable repeated i had one working with me at the local factory but he lost his job due to refusing to go to work and told me that i was going to have to support him my love for my brothers won out i kept supporting them for another 6 months things just kept getting worse and worse repeated my neighbors started telling me i should watch my back because they were telling them they wanted to kill me everything came to a head i came home from work one day to find out one brother had beaten another with a pipe and gone to jail after he got out i told them that i was too emotionally wracked and spent to support them any more they resorted to blaming me for everything that had happened to them and decided they should move back in with their mother i could not as hard as i tried convince them that it was the worst idea in the world they had made up their minds though and i spent the last of my money on their greyhound tickets to the mother in colorado i was completely devastated at this point emotionally and financially i quit my job because i was having problems going to work on time and not falling apart constantly a friend of mine offered to take me to florida and help him set up a business fixing cars i figured i needed to learn a skill of some kind i ultimate figured myself to be a techie i went and long story short he ended up closing the shop and being a complete asshole to me i was homeless for a few weeks until i found work at a local factory that made textiles after a few months everything seemed to be doing ok then the shift i was on was laid off and i was homeless again i wasn t meeting people or making friends at this point i did not trust anyone and was suffering from mentall illness i did not even realize i had i found a job working at mcdonalds right before i was about to get kicked out of my trailer there as a crew member for a few months got promoted to a shift manager felt like i was doing ok but then it started going bad again the store manager used and abused me by working me long hours and generally being a huge ass i found out he was an ex felon and had a history of abusing employees but as it was a franchise and florida is an at will employment state there wasn t much i could do about it the owners of the business knew this all too well i bided my time until i found a cheap apartment in where there was a local community college moved there and started working at a distribution center for family dollar it was around the time i started working at mcdonald s that i decided to get professional help for my mental problems mcdonald s was extremely stressful and wasn t helping in that department anyways i worked at family dollar for awhile trying to save up money unfortunately i had a horrible episode of depression that lasted for a couple weeks it culminated in me not being able to wake up for work anymore i was literally sleeping about 18 20 hours a day called a friend i had made while working for mcdonald s telling her i was coming very close to committing suicide she took me to a allcaps csu allcaps crisis intervention unit in panama city i thought it was a good idea but it turned out to be a very bad one i was basically locked into this tiny prison for 3 days with barely a soul talking to me besides the mentally ill patients already there finally talked to the psychiatrist but he did not seem to care and upped my dose of zoloft to 2 0 0 mg a day they released me and i went back home was able to start working again however i was still having extreme problems with sleeping and depression received a huge bill in the mail from the allcaps csu allcaps 3000 + and decided going back there was not an option my counselor told me i should get a physical check up i did and found out i had s disease it s an autoimmune disorder that destroys your thyroid over time and causes symptoms like lack of energy depression and other things was prescribed thyroid replacement pills and received yet another large medical bill i need to mention that at this point i had already started going to my community college but dropped out due to my mental and personal issues fast forward to the present i am got hired at wal mart in july and decided to give school another shot i was betting on my hypothyroidism and depression being held in check enough to move forward with my life however i found out i owed 850 from after dropping out the college stopped accepting student loans altogether this year the explanation is here i even tried applying for personal loans from various banks i was denied each time for not having enough of a credit history and lack of collateral i only have an older car worth about 2k i am now considering suicide more than ever the only thing holding me back before was worry that i would hurt friends and family of mine now however it seems i am truly and utterly alone in this world my family has abandoned me i fucked up my chance at school i work an extremely low paying job at wal mart what is really fucked up about all this is that i believe i truly have potential no ego trip here but i know i am fairly smart i build computers as a hobby and want to make computer science my passion of course this does not mean anything in the real world hard work does i can not even seem succeed in seemingly simple situations though i am sorry if this whole rant came through garbled intelligible there were allcaps many many allcaps details i left out but it would be a literal 500 + page novel to write it all out no tl dr here repeated i just can not come up with one that expresses my feelings well enough this is the first time i have told any of this to someone that i did not trust explicitly hopefully someone that uses reddit has been through something similar and has some useful advice telling me to call a suicide hotline is not going to help tried that already and the disembodied voice that does not know me just makes it worse i am going to find an out either way either a financial way out of this mess or a much more permanent way out if you read through all this thank you very much for your time and good luck to anyone else out there suffering with mental illness and or lack of family support	c
37759	struggling against the urge i have struggled with depression for more than 15 years i have often thought about suicide during that time i have studied and searched out the best ways to do it and developed numerous plans i usually just push the thoughts away and distract myself somehow just find something to occupy my mind until the thoughts go away lately it has escalated and i find myself having to actively fight the urge to kill myself i have a handgun next to my bed and i really emphasis want to shoot myself in the head and be done with it my last objection to suicide is that i know it would hurt my wife but that barrier is deteriorating we are growing further apart as i descend deeper into my depression the worst part is that i am a counselor doing family therapy i should know better and i should not be doing what i am doing while struggling so much with depression and suicidal thoughts i just really want to die so i can stop everything i am just so done it is getting harder to keep myself from killing myself i do not know if i should do something to fight back or to finally push myself over the edge i am just so tired of fighting i do not think i can do it anymore	d
37770	nothing i have tried worked will suicide do it gon na be long sorry for that for years now i have suffered from depression and nothing i did worked this and on top of monophobia fear of being alone left me in a broken sate i have had a lot of friends in the past but they all left now those who did left doesnt make me feel any better i am in a constant feeling of dissapointing them either through failing to help them or just my help being denied by them from the start i tried looking for friends that never worked next there s my psychologist he help a bit sure but it s only once a week and i cant have more than that due to money issues plus last thursday 6 8 we had a meeting with my mother presents one thing that came up was that she basically gave up on me and me and having any sort of future which might be true i am a fucked up anyway unmotivated have no direction as to what i wan na do she s been poisoning me my whole life to work at something my abilities are not even good for and now i got no direction i only live with my mother she s unemployeed and unable to work anywhere i am finishing my contract job soon and very soon have no place to work as well and our money is running out very fast prolly wont last until like 2 3 months i have wrote here and on r depression before so i doubt this will work but still i cant think of any other option will suicide work i hate myself i hate my life i hate the fact that i have only one option left and i dont want to use that option that s why i am writing it here nothing works out and time is running out i cant take it anymore i have been depressed ever since i can remember nothing and i mean nothing go my way i have no money my mother and i live alone none of us work or has any chance of working in any of the areas nearby we are hated in the community we live in we have no hope and i am giving up i got no friends anymore nothing i do succeed i meet with a psychologist but it s barely doing anything i have monophobia and so since i got no friends it s making me have constant anxiety attacks that with depression just makes me wan na ends things i cant take it anymore it s just not worth anything	c
12129	is this a reaction i am on a high dose of anti depressants and occasionally i will feel down to the pits of society repeated is this just normal human sadness or should i contact my psych i will def see my psych but i have been on this medication for over a year is it normal for it to start reacting this late	b
12540	i just can not stand being worthless anymore ever since middle school i never fit in anytime i have remotely showed interest in anyone i have been flat out rejected that was before i came out and now i am in college and it just has gotten worse and worse and i can not take it anymore i have never dated anyone and no one has ever showed interest in me i guess i am just so fucking ugly and unattractive that no one wants to go near me i just do not get it literally since age 13 i have always been the odd one out no boyfriend girlfriend my first kiss was last year at age 20 last year one of my coworkers told me that one of her residents we are ra s thought i was cute never in my life has anyone ever described me as attractive cute or hot or anything remotely positive the sheer excitement and joy that i got was indescribable it took a whole semester before i talked to the guy because i was so shy he messaged me on grindr and eventually gave me his number we probably hung out once and he immediately went in for sex i wasn t ready i do not think i operate like that i hate the way my body looks and i just could not keep going with him and told him no he immediately left my room and i cried my eyes out how fucking embarrassing after the spring semester we got to know each other a little more in the most minimalist sense i always wanted to hang out he always just wanted to hook up and would often leave after we got physical i am still a virgin but i have hooked up with him a couple of times and i started to crush really hard this year probably more than 3 4 of the time when i text him he ignores me but then when i see him in person acts like everything is great and then says things like we should hang out i just do not know what to fucking do this spring semester i keep seeing this other guy who is probably gay writing all over his facebook wall and him liking his posts and whatnot i just figured he s found someone who is not worthless like i am and probably is having a great time with him i am so sick of being alone i am so sick of feeling worthless i just do not feel like i fit in even in the gay culture of hook ups and everything i have been frustrated with this guy for the past year and just can not get anywhere with figuring out what he wants what we are get closure on it i knew he had a reputation as pretty much every gay at my university of sleeping around i am just so fucking envious that i can not fit in like that so then i go out on a limb tonight and message someone on grindr who i thought was attractive he also has a reputation but i just wanted to try i have never messaged anyone on grindr because i know they are just going to ignore or block me i am just so fucking unattractive he messages back i get excited that i do not respond for like an hour but then ask a simple question like what are you studying then i sat there for 30 minutes watching him being online the whole time and then he fucking blocks me why the fuck would he respond if he were just going to block me and what the fuck did i do wrong why is my life always like this and why can not i just find someone to be with i am just so fucking worthless when i noticed that he blocked me i just cried my eyes out i fucking cut both of my wrists and now have blood all over my hands i am sick of being alone i am sick of being unattractive i am sick of being worthless and i am sick of not being able to do anything about it why the fuck was i born like this what the hell is wrong with me i am not worthy of living and can not making anyone happy reddit i am a 20 year old male gay bisexual student i constantly find myself falling for someone and putting them on a golden pedestal i think they are amazing near perfect no bad qualities etc this just feeds off of the little if any self worth i have for myself since i do not think that i am good enough attractive enough good looking enough to make another person happy as a child i was physically abused by my father emotionally separated from my mother and sexually abused by my baby sitter in high school i never dated because i felt i wasn t good enough now in college i have been having these problems become more intense my body image issues are growing i can not look at myself and not feel disgusted i started cutting my wrists and i went about a week without eating anything now i do not feel attracted to that many people and when i find someone attractive i usually have an intense draw to them i can not tell if that s normal or if those feelings are just what a crush is i feel as if most people can look around and point out who they find attractive whereas i do not find many people attractive and they pretty much just look the same as in i have a type at the beginning of this year on of my fellow resident advisers told me that one of her residents thought i was cute of course i just could not believe it since who could possibly find me attractive long story short i have been talking to this guy and last wednesday he came over to my room to watch a movie things got a little heated and we started making out my first kiss at age 20 repeated another reason why i am pathetic and i had to stop him when he started taking off my shirt truth is i wish i felt comfortable about sex and exposing my body but i just can not make myself be vulnerable like that i am trying to figure out why i said no since it was all in my head rather than anything to do with him i am ashamed about my body and just wanted to spare the vulnerability of exposing myself to him this boy is also much more experienced than i am whether it be in relationships or random hook ups mostly the latter i could not tell if he was just trying to get with me or if i actually mean something to him i am a volunteer emergency medical technician i can pull people out of car wrecks without hesitation but when it comes to relationships and sex i am a nervous and pathetic wreck myself what the hell is wrong with me i want to feel worthy and wanted i just want someone to feel happy just being around me i do not want to look at myself and find the smallest things to try to

12853	fear of eternal damnation because of sexuality i want to die i am a lesbian and even though i logically am pretty agnostic and do not believe in an afterlife i am still so terrified of going to hell for being in a gay relationship i have no idea what to do this started a year and a half ago and i was able to come out of it but i have never fully gotten over it i guess logically in my mind i know being gay is fine and that if there is a god if he was just he would not care because he made me like this but logic and anxiety do not go together at all i was triggered yesterday and i have had constant terror to the point where i can hardly do anything have not eaten in over 24 hours and can barely sleep and my mind will not stop trying to rationalize here s my process 1 i know that i will not go to hell because it does not exist god does not exist even if he does many christians think that he accepts gays but then i wonder what if they are wrong what if he is not just and he will punish me forever in eternal pain in hell for being in a gay relationship 2 even if i do accept that logically this makes no sense what if i can not get out of this what if i have to end a relationship with a girl i am in love with to fix this i have had issues with this before and come out of it but it almost cost me my life i can not do that again please help me how do i learn how to accept myself and realize i will not be eternally punished by a god i do not even believe in allcaps update allcaps my best friend is planning to commit suicide in 12 days and i do not know what to do first post here have escalated since then i have nailed down the date to february 15th and a lot more information has come up i received a call today from a friend who informed me that my best friend had traveled to see her and told her of her plan to commit suicide another friend called me yesterday and told me the same i was also informed that one of the people she told who is in her army unit contacted her commanding officer and the cops came to the house got her parents involved but ultimately did nothing she is still planning on coming and seeing me saturday in the meantime i have called the national suicide prevention line twice for advice i have sent anonymous screenshots to her parents in which she details her plans and i even contacted the police department all of which did nothing i finally got in touch with the allcaps nco allcaps of her unit who said she would be contacting the commander i will find more about that tomorrow i will update if people are interested my best friend is planning to commit suicide in 12 days and i am not sure what to do my best friend is 19 a lesbian and very depressed she s tried zoloft but gave up after a few months because it did not make her feel better obviously with antidepressants a person has to find the right pill for it to effectively work i went through 4 in order to find the right medicine for myself so she has not tried here are the details she s posted on tumblr and twitter her suicide plans so i am skeptical of whether or not this is legit or a cry for help she texted me weirdly the other night asking to come visit me at college and refused to answer when i asked why she wanted to come so quickly she bought a plane ticket to missouri we live in nc for this thursday to see a fellow army friend before she commits suicide she s planning on coming to my college this saturday i want to show her parents her tumblr posts and tweets anonymously so that they will do something about it as my friend plans on doing this in 12 days but i am terrified that she will be furious and know it was me and not only cut off friendship ties but also out me to my conservative mother i am a lesbian as well however i am willing to take those chances because it s her life any advice on what to do this is driving me crazy sad	b

5224	been having thoughts lately repeated the last few repeated well repeated years i have been having some bad thoughts i am 33 it started when my mom passed away about 4 years ago i was always closest to my mom my dad worked a swing shift job when i was young i did not see him much if he was home it was one of those well you need to be quiet because your father is sleeping kinda things was the one i could always go to for advicesince she passed away i have become a pretty hardcore alcoholic she always did her best to keep me away from alcohol since addiction runs in our family and i was good drank once or twice a week never to excesssince she s passed away i can drink a 12 pack a night probably more if i wanted but i limit myself to that and other things in my life have gone downhill i drink so i just pass out if i try to go to sleep i see things in my sleep repeated things i do not like things like the faces of my mom my dad and my older sister disappointed that i have wasted my life i see the faces of my best friends alex and laughing at me because they have made something for themselves repeated gotten married had kids etc repeated and at 33 i am still pretty much alonetoday i found out i have 10 days to vacate my apartment or i will be formally evicted i am 2 months behind on my rent due to a bad time where i got demoted at work and rent from making roughly 1000 ever 2 weeks to around 450 if i get evicted i will probably be homeless awhile back my older sister said i could stay at her place until i got on my feet at this point getting on my feet would involve paying off the roughly 2500 in back rent 250 in back cellphone bill and whatever it takes to fix my truck i d bring this up to her but she s had her own problems my niece has had some health issues in recent weeks and my nephew her oldest child is strongly swinging towards marine boot camp and i can hear her hold back tears as she talks about that repeated thge last thing i want to bring on her is hey repeated you want to take in your loser homeless brother because i know she d do it without hesitation the more things get worse the more i think about going to the drug store behind my apartment and getting a bottle of sleeping pills then going to the liquor store and getting a bottle of whiskey and just going to sleep i have thought of other ways and that seems to be the best i walk to and from work along busy streets and it would be easy to just accidentally step in front of a car on the road but then i d have to deal with my loved ones seeing me like that repeated so i figure pills and booze is the easiest way	d
5484	how do i let my friend know i am there for him one of my friends is having suicidal thoughts and i just wanted to know if you had any advice on how to approach him about it we have been friends for a while and i want him to know that i am here for him what are some ways to start this conversation	a
5616	getting through the bad days hey r i wanted to share something with you all that helped me get through my own dark thoughts i am not entirely sure if this belongs more in r depression but i will post it there too and if this is in the wrong feel free to delete it my goal is to help you from going down the path i came very close to taking a little background between 2005 and today i have been depressed i have harmed myself i have thought about how much better life would be if it were over i have entered suicide pacts i have attended hundreds of hours of counselling and therapy and for the past year and a half i have been taking anti depressants it peaked in 2007 when i was less than a week away from setting a plan in motion to end it all i will not bore you with the details but a friend of mine passed away that year and it began to change my perspective though i was barely motivated to do so i scrapped my plan and begun to try to live my life in a way that would make my friend proud since to do otherwise would cause the same amount of pain to my friends and family as his death did to me i will not lie to you i have since had my bad days i sometimes sit inside a dark tunnel for hours with no light at the end of it and just feel totally helpless and am unable to do anything with my day except struggle i forget about everything that matters to me and my problems are amplified i engage in a allcaps very allcaps zero sum thinking my therapist recommended i try and think positive thoughts to fight these kind of days since some would get particularly awful i went a step further and compiled a list of what i call things to remember in the event that these bad days occur so without further ado repeated it will get better depression might seem like it is permanent but a light exists at the end of the tunnel you are human the pain you feel is very real but you can get past it people care about you whether you believe this or not it s true and you care about them in return do not let them down do your best whatever that may be do not give in despite how much you might want to allcaps you can do it allcaps be yourself no matter what people will always be proud of you to quote the late dr be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind do not matter and those who matter do not mind there are always options and ways out that are not as extreme as what you are thinking of try to think short term like running a marathon just one more kilometre i am canadian or mile repeated you are allcaps not allcaps alone not only is reddit here for you but you have family and friends who are more than happy to help shoulder your burdens failure or uncertainty does not mean the end of the world take things on at your own pace you are awesome do not let anyone or anything make you think otherwise live life the way you want to live it every day is your own in other words emphasis if you need help ask for it the people who care about you will be there for you no matter what do not bottle up your feelings inside take advantage of the good days one other thing i would recommend is to make a list of things that make you happy even though as i know myself that when depression is in full swing it is hard to think about but it can be the simplest of things that life has to offer these are all reasons worth living tl dr remember people love you people care about you people will cry when you are gone they are one of the many reasons to live edit 1 i am an epic fail at reddit formatting apparently	b
5916	if i kill myself nothing will exist i would not have to worry about people missing me or them being hurt by what i did since no one can prove to me that they are actually real and not just a figment of my imagination i would not have to think about how things might have gotten better i would not have to feel like such a creep or idiot anymore i would not have to feel anything it sounds so nice	c
123	possibly just destroyed any chance of success and happiness in my life i got a 60 on my 2 nd biochemistry exam how is this even happening i studied a lot for that test and actually felt confident i am fucking intelligent as hell and managed to get a mother fucking 33 on my mcat i should not be having trouble with this now i have a c in the class and have to do really well on the 3 rd exam otherwise i am fucked i will end up with a c destroy my already borderline allcaps gpa allcaps and get rejected from med school i do not fucking deserve this but whatevs there goes any hope i had for a life yeah i know that shit happens but i already went through it in undergrad and improved my allcaps gpa allcaps dramatically towards the end and did spectacularly in grad school i am supposed to be better than this now but i have just shown these schools that nothing has changed and that i am still subpar as a student and if it does not work out nothing is open i have a masters from a shit school and little to really impress with other than some shitty publications i just have to focus entirely on the 3 rd exam and hope to the fucking heavens that i get an a so i can come out of this class with a b which would instead screw me over just a bit i can not deal with this fucking failure thank god i have a wine bottle to calm myself down and not get into a depression perfectionism rant idk if this is the right place to post about this but repeated idk what s wrong with me i do almost everything i can to feel better about myself yet i still feel like utter sht i feel so pathetic because i automatically compare myself to what person a and person b on my facebook newsfeed are doing nothing that i achieve satisfies me in even the slightest way for example i scored in the 9 0 th percentile on the allcaps mcat allcaps yet i can not stop thinking about how i did not do as well as i should have and how others scored higher than i did i am not even a jealous person i just feel terribly for not being the best in my chosen area i know it s irrational and stupid of me but it s like my nature i can not stop thinking about how i am still in graduate school versus having a job single versus having a boyfriend gay versus straight that s probably because of my religious upbringing gross versus hot etc you get the point i am really not looking for pity at all i just have to admit this to someone even if it s random strangers on the internet	b
1264	i tried again i tried again for the first time since june i relapsed last night went to school and broke i went home and started taking as many pills as i could then halfway through the bottle i thought about my my best friends and i got scared not of dying but of what my death would do to them i called my best friend and he left class to come see me he does not know i tried again but he knew i was upset so we just sat and talked about funny stuff for a while until he had to go back to school i just repeated everything as become too much i am always sick no matter what i eat do wear whatever i am just always in pain or nauseated and it s stressful now my parents are splitting and my wants to move to a city two hours away with a population over 2 0 x my current cities population it s terrifying and i know if we do move there i will not survive i will not go back to school or make friends i will just repeated die inside until i wind up killing myself i am scared i want to die but i do not want to hurt my family and friends repeated but i am such a failure and a disgrace to the family sometimes i wonder if they would even miss me at all repeated i know this probably all does not make sense but i just needed to vent sorry am i just stalling it all started with the first cut i had never truly experienced self inflicted pain i hadn t seen the light in it chicken scratching the salt and ice challenge hell even the rush of jumping from a height that made your legs fell numb as they crashed against the ground no pain was never something i had been used to but i wasn t able to take it anymore the strange desire to cause myself pain i was trying to hold onto life but i could barely see my life before me i was blind to it all life was dull dragging and every thought was another onslaught of hatred i don t really know anymore i m too much of a coward to take my life but the thoughts have continued they ve become something i think of by the hour i can t feel happy i can t feel sympathy i don t really know anymore i used to be happy i was really happy for years and then i just collapsed i ve stopped cutting myself but it didn t help it s the only way i can hide from my friends and family i told my internet friends because at one point they were keeping me alive but now i really don t have anything i can t get anything across anymore i find well i write this that i am being overdramatic i mean i m not fifteen yet i ve just finished my first year of high school shouldn t i be happy summer yeah two months with nothing to do and to be lost in thought while my mother bitches at me for every movement i make i want to die i want to feel the soft caress of peace as it finally overwhelms me but what can i do it s not like anyone would really miss me everyone would get over me soon enough even the teachers i formed close bonds with would get over me at the same speed as my friends repeated	d

1523	i have no friends and it depresses me i have legitimately tried making friends it s just difficult for me because i am usually not an easy person to get along with and a lot of my interests are not exactly mainstream there s probably an argument to be made that i am a stereotypical nerd because i like star trek maybe i d be better off dead i have no idea how to make friends anymore and at this point i do not see any point because i have struggled with suicidal thoughts for so long that chances are i d only be hurting them in the long run	c

899	i think everyone might be a liar recently i tried to commit suicide i do not want to get into it but basically it involved me eating an undisclosed number of prescription pills and upon realizing they were not going to kill me pleading with the lord to take me just end my miserable life and take me away from all the horrible people who claim they love me but scream they could not care less with their actions upon finding out i tried to commit suicide a friend first yelled then cried at me told me how horrible it is to lose someone and then realize there was something he could have done but did not not only is this person my friend but they are my new live in roommate i apologized and explained why i wanted to commit suicide i am a very anxious person and for the last two weeks he s been asking me to grin and bear it as his girlfriend essentially invades my home i grinned and beared it for as long as i could but then when i tried in the gentlest way i knew how to suggest that she needed to not be at my house so much he bullies me into putting up with it which only makes me feel allcaps more allcaps violated allcaps more allcaps taken advantage of the thing is repeated his girlfriend has now been here for the last 48 hours solid he told me he s lost friends due to suicide and regretted not doing something about it i straight up told him what i needed to not go to that dark place and it s like he cranked it up a notch i am convinced more then ever that he wants me to kill myself how do you fricken reconcile this blatant bullshit i wish i could save you repeated but also fuck you there s a very simple answer to this supposed predicament allcaps go somewhere else allcaps leave me in peace allcaps stop allcaps making me uncomfortable by permanently inviting a woman who has disrespected me in my own home several times even my husband who is so laid back he s practically dead turned to me this morning and told me he does not like her she s too entitled allcaps too allcaps spoiled her attitude is that we are in the wrong for not inviting her with open arms as she waltzes in our home without so much as saying hello to us allcaps every fricken day allcaps for the past 2 and 1 2 weeks it s like there are soulless monsters inhabiting my home we give they take we do not give they take we ask they blow up like we are insane people and it s literally driving me to the brink everyone uses me and i simply have nothing left i recently took in a homeless friend or a friend who would be homeless without me and was super stoked about hanging out and stuff allcaps as soon allcaps as they moved in they revealed they had a new girlfriend and said girlfriend is over allcaps all the time allcaps i have told him numerous times that the girlfriend can not live here but he does not care he always tells me to grit my teeth and bear it and i am like repeated allcaps you are a guest in my home allcaps allcaps what the fuck are you talking about allcaps today i tried to impose a time limit on their visits no more then 18 hours a day and they both ganged up on me and more or less called me not a friend what kind of friend does this repeated what kind of friend moves in and then moves a completely second person in repeated i am so at my witts end that i tried to kill myself i took the pills i wrote the note the only thing that saved me was how uncomfortable the bathtub became i moved locations and then swiftly fell asleep i do not want this person in my home anymore he scoffs at my rules and his girlfriend openly mocks me but i can not get rid of them because every time i try they convince me i am overreacting	d

46258	i can not stop running away from my problems i break easily and it culminates in me trying to take my life almost every time i feel like i am a coward and i can not face the consequences of my actions this causes so much stress on my parents that i am reluctant to speak to them anymore about it i do not know what i want to hear from this community i just need to vent i guess i have had to lie for months now i have been depressed since i was about 13 i used to be on and off suicidal but now i have been constantly thinking of just ending it all i have lied to my therapist and my parents about it my mom always guilted me into not doing it in the past and my dad just acted annoyed i have not told any of my friends either i just want to be happy again	c
46267	it seems beautiful to me living with depression is not fun and it s what lead me to this point i find the idea of ending life on your own terms to be so beautiful like you have suffered for so long with little to no one giving a legitimate kind word that you have decided enough is enough if no one else cares at least you care enough for yourself so you end the pain for yourself and no one else who cares about how the other people feel it s not like they gave a shit anyway i just think it s beautiful at least i hope so or this new years is not gon na be well	c
46434	i am just tired i realized that i am tired of it all i do not want to go on i am a 23 year old college graduate with a dead end job because that s all i can get up to my neck in debt living in a shitty apartment there is literally no way to advance beyond my position at work or get a raise i will be driving a forklift for the rest of my life making just emphasis enough to pay my bills and feed myself i am healthy as a horse too so i have easily got another 60 70 years of this shit left it s not just work i have not dated anyone in 6 years i had a bad relationship that killed my self esteem and i have never recovered i am a goddamn 23 year old virgin and i hate myself so fucking much i am pretty good looking but i think there s just something wrong with me that repulses people all i want out of life is a nice place to live a job i enjoy and someone to share that life with from where i am right now i do not see that happening for me i will always be a loser i will always be alone and i will always hate myself my lease ends in april and i think i am going to abandon my shit wander into the mountains and see how long i can survive off the land i know i can make it to winter if i have changed my mind by then i will come down if not i can not think of a more beautiful place to lie down and die than a snow covered clearing in the rockies that being said i know this would hurt my family as much as i want to die i can not stand the thought of hurting them i guess i just need a reason to keep going i need something to give me the strength not to curl up and die like a tired old dog	b
46530	i feel like no one would miss me if i were gone hi all i am really embarrassed to say this but i am a 16 year old guy and i feel completely empty i can not go to my parents for help and i seriously thought about killing myself a half hour ago if i had a gun at that time i would have just pulled the trigger it s not because i get bullied or anything like that i feel like i have accomplished nothing with my life i do not really enjoy doing many things i have had an anger problem for a long time and hate people i am not super smart at school i am not good looking i am lazy i am not athletic i have no close friends and i feel so so empty no one at school would feel bad for me theyd all recognize me one day and thatd be it the only reason i really want to stay is because of my mom if i were to go she would be devastated and she has done nothing wrong	c
46616	attempting suicide as we type i have posted with my story on here before no hits whatsoever posted my story in depression no hits whatsoever girlfriend gave me hope until she decided to leave me her reason she s unhappy and does not want to drag me down with her i gave her all i had left unconditional love here is my status shortened repeated i do not have a permanent residency i live off my friends charity i am a burden to all around i do not get to see my family someone took and shot my dog he was my buddy and security blanket i understand some people can not get too attached to an animal but he was my obi my damned ugly old deaf cockapoo but he was mine i needed him alot more than he needed me we d just sit on the porch drinking some arizona green tea for a few hours he d just sit in my lap and let me know i still had him i am schizo meaning i have episodes where things go bat shit insane for me thoughts that are not mine telling me how much of a failure i am and how no one loves me all lies but very loud and very often worst trip was a group of intangible shadows swarming my vision was a little freaky for 15 minutes i have been accused of touching my sister edit step sister blasphemy of the highest degree gave up on me can not help me i feel as if i have no more hope left in me but that s a lie because i am writing this i guess i just want to go comatose for a couple years and try again later it s becoming more and more difficult to focus an aspirin every 5 minutes i am on hashtag 13 hashtag now pitiful but it s all i got around i am tired of the hurt last year round 1 8 bday i slept with my friends mom she and i had a year long relationship rings ohana the whole nine yards was pissed understandably me out estranged relationship there rambling now i moved to tn from nc to find work to help her i was depressed and abused alcohol a month after the move 5 days after my bday on june 24 she wanted to see other people next day she fucked a dude it was only not long ago i knew her for who she was a right now kind of woman funny you d think a guy my age 19 would be the right now cheating type as opposed to a 40 old woman wrong some kids grow up to be just bigger kids some kids never have a chance to be a kid funny eh i am on pill hashtag 15 hashtag i am so lost and so hopeless i have made so many wrong choices so many bad judgements hurt and disappointed so much i am done for now if i live i will check all my allcaps omg allcaps your an idiot nightsaber comments if not then just read it as a fictional depressing story and go on your way everyone did my last 2 attempts repeated allcaps edit allcaps this is the part where i sheepishly return to let everyone know i could not do it the very moment i posted this momma contacted me and i just couldnt do it knowing that she d lose her oldest son i had 3 superheros last night my bro herman back in nc an old love not mentioned above and no last names for anonymity sorry guys for getting all worked up and making others worry as a result it was a bit selfish of myself for wanting an out so badly i would disregard how it made others feel primal in a way but what happened happened again sorry all last time i felt this low i took a 22 in a field and sat for a bit thinking about it all but that time i had a little bit more going for me than i do right now so 15 was my last pill i threw up 15 minutes after posting and bouncing back at a pretty decent pace from my judgement just one last time sorry everybody	d
46771	probably gon na swallow the pills soon i do not really know what to say i feel like i should go to the hospital but i do not feel like i should unless i actually hurt myself it s silly you know people go to suicide wards for attempts not for saying they are suicidal but this is not the point i feel like i have no reason to live i want to see what death is like i feel so bad these days that i can not even look forward to the things i used to i am transgender and face harassment constantly my fiance does not approve of me being polysexual because i figured out that i was in the middle of the relationship he is insisting on keeping the relationship monogamous i used to tell myself that if i ever felt like death was the only option that i would run away and enjoy myself by camping forever i do not even see a purpose to that now either i am only a few days from graduating high school and i do not even care i am supposed to move to asheville with my fiance and attend college i was so excited and now i just feel trapped and like there is not even a purpose any more i think i am gon na take all of my meds lamictal zoloft and seroquil and see if that works i think while i fall asleep forever that i will listen to the unicorns who will cut our hair when we are gone album i do not know why i am posting here i do not know what else to do i can not tell anyone else	d
46835	post from r drugs why am i not dead from r drugs how much hard liquor + xannies do i need to reliably kill myself how do you overdose on painkillers without throwing up i have 100 pills stockpiled x post	d
47012	losing the last thing keeping me alive i can not take this anymore i feel like i have nothing to live for anymore the only reason i have not killed myself in this last year is for other people like everything else all i do is think about other people s happiness and how i do not want to make them sad by killing myself but i think it s time to start thinking about me for a change	c
47251	i just held a fully loaded gun to see what it felt like and i will probably be back then i will not have to feel ever again it felt nothing like i would have expected i did not really feel sad or any type of thrill this gun was fully loaded it does not belong to me but now i know where it is and i will probably be back i was in my mom s room with the door locked and i was thinking about pulling the trigger but i kind of did not want to because there is people in the house these people being younger family members and i would not want them to see everything in person my mom came to the door and it scared me because i thought she was at work so i hurried and put the gun back where i found it now if i had been all alone in the house i probably would not be typing this as much of an excuse it sounds like it s the truth i am tired of this fucking oh that s life bullshit	d
47572	every once in a while i just put a gun in my mouth simply because it feels good do not judge me disclaimer i am not about to commit suicide i would feel real trapped in this life if i did not know i could commit suicide at any time hunter i feel like my head is going to explode because of that unbearable chaos of thoughts in my head i just like to take my gun load it and put it in my mouth just to realize that there always is a way out and i can get so close to it whenever i want i do not want advice i just wanted to leave this here i have no idea why some of you might will say that someday i will end up killing myself by mishandling the gun so may it be if you are close to killing yourself there s always one good reason why you should not do it	d
47607	need advice for a friend my friend and i are concerned about a mutual friend our friend we will call her is a very anxious socially awkward depressed person has expressed wanting to kill herself very recently and it s been said more than 1 time she is very erratic when you talk to her she can not hold a conversation about 1 topic for more than a few sentences her depression and anxiety have reached the level of major concern she will not take the initiative to get help so my friend and i are looking for help how do we get help for i am prepared for to be mad at me for it and or lash out but i do not care my main concern is getting help what do we do	a
47614	i promised myself 10 months ago that i would not kill myself unless i could not change even one thing between then and now the end of the year nothing has changed in february i was going to kill myself i got scarred after trying and called a friend who made me make the above promise i tried to change i went back to school made a s without trying and learned nothing i tried to look for a different job no luck i got on anti depressants and i just feel like i am balanced on a seesaw i tried dating and came up used and feeling empty i hate myself and my life and i just do not see a point to the struggle anymore should i seek medical help if i am daydreaming about killing myself i hate my job my dad my life and myself for the last three days i have been fantasizing about killing myself i am at work right now and i want to lock myself in the unisex bathroom lock the door cut my wrists open with a box cutter and just let the faucet wash everything down the drain it use to be i d cry when i thought about these things but not this time i have nothing i will be one less thing for everyone to worry about sure they will be sad but they will get on with their lives just like they are doing now my passing will eventually be nothing edit thank you all for the support and advice i talked to some friends yesterday went to school which is apparently where i feel the most comfortable and actually had a rather nice evening i really do appreciate your concern and the time you took to check on a fellow human being heart	c
47676	allcaps please help allcaps i can not do this anymore my so 20 f is diagnosed with anxiety and depression and keeps threatening to kill herself when we argue i can not deal with it anymore and it hurts long post be prepared so me and my girlfriend have been together for almost two years we have had our ups and downs but in the end we have always been there for each other recently however for the past few months her anxiety and panic disorders have both increased and she has been getting anxious and panicky more frequently than ever about a year ago she moved out of her parents house and moved into an apartment complex closer to her school it went well at first and she was able to pay rent on time no financial stress or anything of the matter as time went on it got stressful though because she wasn t able to pay off rent in time or was left with only 50 to last her the next two weeks that added to her stress and i believe her anxiety as well about a month or two ago she got a cat and had it registered as a service animal her roommate let her keep it as long as it was a kitten but when she saw it made up an excuse that she was allergic to cats and did not want it there it was already signed into the lease and she was paying extra for it to stay there but she decided to leave the apartment when one of her other roommates said that the roommate allergic to cats wanted to leave then front doors and my girlfriends door open around the house so the cat could get out making that the last straw she decided to move out looking for a place to stay and me helping her along the way added even more stress to her already stressful situation me and my girlfriend as i said have been together for almost 2 years we have had our ups and downs and there was a time we did not see each other for over 8 months causing our relationship to become long distance i have a problem with my anger and i have been stressed out recently trying to pay rent at my dads house trying to pay off something personal i owe and working three jobs while also trying to make time to see her unfortunately and i am not afraid to admit the truth i know my anger problems have led to her anxiety and panic disorder being more serious there are times i can not control what i say i am not physically abusive in no way could i ever hit her but i am verbally abusive when i am angry i seek to hurt her and say things that i know are mean its rare that i get to that point where i am verbally abusing her but i can be very mean and hurtful and i known that has lead to her anxiety being more serious there are times where she does things that are very unwise and even dumb i tell her buy she gets very upset very fast for example she was scared to look at her bank account after spending a rather large amount of money on something and only after some days and me constantly reminding her to look she finally checked her account and saw she owed over 205 + dollars in overdraft fees then she could not pay rent because over 50 % of her paycheck went into into paying the overdraft fees and she did not want to go to the bank to get overdraft forgiveness or ask to put a hold on her card because she s too anxious to talk to people that leaves me frustrated and angry because i know she s just losing money i know i can not just say stop being anxious because that is not how it works it s difficult not to say that though when i am angry certain things she does not do that is common sense to anyone else is what frustrates me but when i tell her she thinks i am mad and then she starts getting angry and saying its not her fault she has a disorder and that i should not be mad at her it s her disorder not her i want to help her but i am not good at dealing with her when i am upset i do not know how to be there for her when she s anxious or panicky i know its simple but when i am angry its hard i say things i regret when i am angry so when i am starting to get angry i know and i try to tell her i ask her to give me at least 5 10 minutes to calm down and get my mind off it so i do not get worse and say things i will regret unfortunately though she just keeps talking and will not be respectful to my wishes she says to her that when i am upset she chooses to talk about it to solve it and if we do not talk she will start to get anxious and panic while i choose to just stop talking and ask for a few minutes she likes to talk it out right away i do not and because of that it makes our arguments 100000 times worse because it gets me mad that she can not respect what i ask and that s to be left alone so i can calm down then because i am angry shes she gets more panicky because i am angry then goes on to blame me for making her panic because i do not want to talk it out and say things like all i am trying to do is talk it out and be nice but you are angry and yelling at me it upsets me when she says these things because it s been almost two years she will also say i do not love her which is untrue i have been there for her since day one and she should know by now how i get when i am angry i have thought about taking anger management classes and now more then ever i am considering it i will post in comments more	a
47899	nihilist depression i have been depressed for years now and college does not help where i come from we do not have lots of jobs and i can not really finish my college degree i do not know what to do with my life and i think of killing myself every day sometimes i just think about it sometimes i really want to do it i find no meaning in life because it is of little consequence i do not think i can influence the world in any way and i think life is just suffering so i try to make the best of it while i am still on college i came here looking for thoughts on the matter it s not something fixable because i will always see the universe as meaningless and consequenceless if this is not the right place to post this i am sorry but i just want to talk to someone	c
47912	i lost a friend to suicide today yes another a year ago saturday someone else i knew committed suicide that person and i were not on speaking terms at the time but i was still heart broken and i still am i woke up this morning thinking of her and i knew the date of her death was coming up repeated i was going to try and look at the world differently for her and imagine her at peace instead of imaging the pain she must have felt when she decided to end her life but then another friend of mine committed suicide i found out today about 2 or 3 weeks ago i talked her down from suicide i only knew her through the internet but she was more of a friend than most people in my real life have ever been i thought she was doing better i had not heard from her in awhile but that was normal she d pop up on lj every few weeks i just can not believe she s gone from the world she will never repeated be repeated anything again she will never breathe or sleep it s terrifying i am so afraid of losing people to mental illness i have two people in my life right now who are struggling with depression and suicide more than they ever have before and it scares me i worry about them so much because i truly do not know what i would do without them in this world lately i have been so worried about them and then this happens reminding me yet again that life is incredibly fragile and that i can not fix everything and i do not like it i was suicidal earlier this week i am suicidal on a regular basis but not to the extent that i used to be i used to want to kill myself every single night i never thought i d make it past 18 but now i am 20 i never thought i d have any nights where i could lay in bed in the dark and not want to die but i have them now things changed they did not without effort but they changed i still struggle with depression bipolar ii and suicidal thoughts and other things i do not believe any of those things will ever go away and who knows they could come back full force someday but right now i am okay i never thought i would be but i am so please repeated do not give up not just because losing someone to suicide is an absolutely horrible feeling especially if you what they felt before they attempted i have attempted suicide 3 times but because it can get better allcaps i hate allcaps it when people say that to me when i am depressed but repeated i have to remember to tell myself that feelings past they do not last forever even if they only let up for a few moments each day live for those moments live for the days when those moments will not be as infrequent as they are now i promise you that someday things will be different i promise you i do understand so many people have come back from worse things than i could ever imagine and they are okay today it is possible so please repeated just remember in those moments where everything feels absolutely hopeless that it is not it truly is not even if you usually can not see that deep down you know you know that things can be different someday	b

14310	to all the well intentioned yet ill informed repeated i know you are trying to help i do but as i read through all of these do not do it and here s why posts that have flooded r sw recently all i can think is this person clearly knows nothing about depression just snap out of it is one thing i keep seeing here hey i was depressed but then i got my shit together and now i am happy you can too in another post i read something along the lines of even if you do not have a legitimate emphasis reason to be depressed remember that it s completely normal to have thoughts of killing yourself what okay look i know everyone here just wants to help that s great amazing in fact reddit is such a great and caring community and i mean that in the most sincerest of ways but if you do not truly understand depression i ask you no i beg emphasis you to just stay silent offer support in the comments of course ask questions but do not emphasis pretend to know what it s like to be depressed and definitely emphasis do not act like you are a qualified psychologist it s true that everyone gets depressed from time to time she broke up with me my life is over or my kitteh died i am so sad are normal depressions for us all clinical depression however is an entirely different issue just because you have been sad before does not emphasis mean you know what true depression is like and when you try to give hope to people suffering from it based on that misconception well you are doing more harm than good clinical depression that leads to suicidal ideation is a very serious psychological disorder serious thought of suicide is not normal the deep hole the black dog that is clinical depression is not something one can simply snap their fingers at to get out of my friends i know you all mean well but please stop making posts that belittle this curse while i admire the fact that you want to help i feel insulted by many of these recent posts from people who think this is just a game that is limited to only adolescents i am 30 years old and i have struggled with depression my entire life instead why not just hang out in the comments sections of r suicidewatch new just talk to those who are seriously depressed and suicidal offer an ear give positive feedback but this recent spate of hey i was sad yesterday because my dog died but now i am happy you can be too posts need to stop if you have not suffered from true clinical depression you have no idea what it s like and shame on you for pretending that you do because you are hurting the cause not helping it because i could not stop for death repeated allcaps xkcd allcaps a tendency to melancholy let it be observed is a misfortune not a fault abe lincoln depressed words	b
14680	made an account because i have been feeling more lost than usual lately repeated to give a bit of history 19 year old male i started experiencing some symptoms of depression when i was 17 started therapy in october of 2011 and turned 18 towards the end of october was recommended by my therapist to see a psychiatrist at his firm psychiatrist diagnosed me with major depression in late november early december started treatment to try and kick the depression obviously i am here because everything has failed i turned 19 3 months ago and am still deep in depression i have switched psychiatrists once partway through 2012 and i like my new psychiatrist a lot more but nothing seems to help with my depression though the sleeping aid i have been taking seems to be helping some most of the anti depressants i have taken have either helped only a little none or made me feel worse until i got off them i identify as gay and came out in 2011 around the time i started therapy and i think trying to accept this aspect of me helped throw me into depression in the first place towards the end of august in 2011 my best friend also tried to kill himself though another friend and i managed to save his life by contacting emergency authorities in time to reach him i believe that was another big factor that sent me overboard into depression i also have really bad anxiety at times though it was mostly a problem before i graduated it was crippling and painful at times i d go whole days where my stomach was just sick and i d feel agony because i was so anxious i also struggle with some possible transgender issues though i can not figure out my feelings regarding them they are tearing me apart recently though and i can not seem to shake them even though i tell myself it does not matter right now so basically depressed for well over a year now no end in sight as i do not seem to be getting better and have actually been getting worse again as winter deepens i feel like there s no hope and i feel stupid and worthless all the time i have trouble getting out of bed and i have trouble motivating myself to do things activities i used to enjoy such as video games or reading have diminished to the point where i have not read since i became depressed and play maybe 1 game a day the rest of my time is spent trying to talk to friends or staring at the walls listening to music i spend a great deal of my time lying in bed because i feel so bad and can not bring myself to do anything nor enjoy it if i manage to still try to go out for walks most days with my mom since i can not run anymore due to painful shin splints she and my father have both been supportive of my depression and my gayitude despite this i have felt myself slipping lately all i think about is being dead killing myself ways i would hurt myself i tell all this to my friends and my psychiatrist but unfortunately they all admit to not knowing what to say and i do not blame them i want to make it all end and have the bad feelings stop just looking for some shoulders i guess repeated	c

14713	i am going to do it tonight i have been on this many times i am just filled with so much anger disappointment and sadness over the choices i have made in the midst of depression i can not keep laying in bed all day and night obsessing over my faults and the people i think have done me wrong there s just this sense of relief whenever i think about the fact that i could end it i can not predict when the hell i have created for myself in my mind will end but i feel relieved that i can permanently stop it that i can have a break i am going out with a homemade noose crafted from my robe tie i can no longer wait for the universe to make things better anybody else s soul tired through the power of social media i found out hours ago that someone i liked was spending time with someone i suspected they might have been talking to in addition to talking to me this is not the first nor second time this is happened in fact it s taken me a long time to try to convince myself that history does not always repeat itself but now it has i am not heartbroken i did not love this person but the small false promise that maybe this time someone thought more of me than to just passively talk flirt with for months was overwhelming i know that i can no longer allow myself to be strung along but it feels like this may have been the last straw i will not kill myself over this person he is not worth it but i can see myself killing myself over the situation and fear that i may just be one of those people who can not find a partner i have had 1 boyfriend in my 27 years that lasted a month i hate that my worth gets wrapped up in someone else just because i fear abandonment and i have been lonely my whole life and i hate that as a clinically depressed person this illness will never go away and i will have to always seek treatment is anybody else s soul just tired suicide texting line is there one i do not want to call anybody as i am having a hard time speaking or is there a chat room or something sometimes help on reddit can move too slow or it s sparse people get overlooked why am i worth living seriously this has become my clinically depressed ass s new home i ask this question because as thoughts of suicide keep flittering in and out of my head and i keep reading posts on here of people in similar situations i truly wonder what is true self worth and it pertains to valuing your life someone please articulate this i have brief moments of feeling ok that are always accompanied with fear and anxiety because i know the dark feelings will come back and fast some people say do not kill yourself to punish someone else because then they have won but if your dead then you will not care and if someone else says that suicide will permanently keep you from better days again if you are dead then you will never care nor feel terrified of the days when things truly are better it s a sick cycle being depressed so someone please explain the point of self worth because when i am not tired of feeling worthless i busy being tired of being genuinely confused about seeing good in myself i shutter at the thought of writing loving myself i may cross post this in r depression just because i really want to hear a thoughtful and well reasoned answer i just want to love things again that s all i have all 1830 mgs of cymbalta in a drink ready to go bottom line i just do not know how to feel better from my window i just watched my mom pull away in my car to go to bridal shower i waved to her even though she could not see me i do not want her to interfere so i have not told her anything but i did tell her goodbye in my own way i will leave her my reddit information so that she can see past posts it really has been a silent struggle these past few years i do not like being human i do not like the ups and downs life just keeps draining the small things that i once loved like music art and movies i have brief spurts of motivation but it disappears quickly and no matter what anyone says i feel like in order for me to get the proper mental health care that i need i need money which i have none no insurance job nothing i recently read this article and it motivated me for about an hour then depressed me when i realized everyone just wants to use each other and they are just out to get what they need even though it is apart of being human i do not want to hurt people and i do not want to be hurt i am the wrong species one that relies on having meaningful relationships which i have never had i am a stepping stone for other humans to get where they are going while i am left behind i just want to stop suffering what advise do you have for someone who feels like they were only put on this earth to make others momentarily happy but at much expense to put it shortly i feel like every time i meet someone i am there just to make them happy like a plaything and then once they are done they move on from me like i did not matter not once has anyone made me feel like i mattered they chase me and no matter how long i make them wait just out of caution the end result is the same as soon as i care then they give up on me i hate feeling like the only people who care are those who are biologically tied to me i can not be with other humans every relationship friendships flings whatever is just so short term due to whatever circumstance i can not take it anymore i feel like if there is a god he she it just put me here for other people to use at the expense of my soul i gave myself a date dec 15 until i take myself out repeated and i do not want to chicken out this time i tried before but i did not cut my wrist deep enough i keep hearing that things get better if you just wait but they have not even though i am trying why are not people like us listened to how are long are we expected to hold on after setback after setback i am happy for the people who did wait and something positive happened to them but everyone can not wait years and years for things to get better sometimes we need a turnaround now and our circumstance just will not permit it no money for professional help no friends that will just materialize out of nowhere no significant others no understanding family members we are lost in the cracks of the universe and it is not our fault i think i am owed a peaceful death when i want it considering all i have given i hope someone s words can change my mind because i have gone through thousands of inspirational quotes and articles on reddit buzzfeed ect and they only resonate with my mind for a second and then repeated i am depressed again please help what my last day was like over the past year i have had a terrible time figuring out what medication to take for my depression after breaking up with my first boyfriend i am 26 this very brief relationship meant more to me than him i weakly tried to slit my wrist it was determined that the medicine i was on a huge contributing factor but when they tried to figure out something else to give me i refused i was done with psychotic meds and the mood swings i just can not try anything else so foreign to my body that brought me so close to the edge so i started intensive group therapy and behold my insurance decides not to pay for my treatment so at 600 a day i was forced to quit why should my problems strain the pockets of my mother who is trying to help and now i am here in the starbucks parking lot just watching the sun disappear and taking in every moment of the evening before i have to go home and do what i need to do to stop this today i woke up thinking that i was going to date myself that i was going to try to fall in love with everything about me so that these seemingly small relationship failures would stop hitting me so hard so i paid myself a compliment put on some nice clothes and went to work but i still could not get the person i used to date out of my mind and desperately want to i am not thought about nor was i really cared for i was just a rebound from his previous relationship no big deal right it is a big deal to a person who has never really had anyone want her for real it s a big deal to someone who is pretty careful about letting people in and once i care they drop me it s a big deal to someone who on her own has pretty high self esteem and has been on this track of learning to love herself only to just let it all shatter once i think i am ready to be intimate and try i just can not get it right it s no one s fault how they treat me but mine it s my fault and because of my personality and lack of luck that i end up with the people i have been with and even though i know that time will heal this i do not want it to i am tired of figuring out what it is about me that causes history to repeat itself and why some people with similar problems are able to find supportive partners it s made me think that all of this is to due with circumstance chance and luck and i am not one of the lucky after secretly crying at work i decided i was going to go to the park to get my homework done and to stay away from the internet namely facebook but when i got there i could not focus then a young couple pulled up walked to the river lovingly and sit at a bench embracing each other it could not have been perfect timing i cried then left then cried so hard i had to pull over during which i screamed multiple times as i have never screamed before finally i decided i d had it i d drive and get the fattiest drink on the starbucks menu enjoy the view and once i got home i d finally be done it s like a weight has lifted off my shoulders i called the suicide hotline but that was a no go they offered to call back and check on me but i would rather that i wasn t there to pick up the phone if suffering is human then i do not want to be human anymore i did not ask for this at least to my knowledge when you have a mental illness the up and down is unbearable i guess i could not do this on my own and i refuse to burden anyone else who has tried to help me thanks for taking the time to read this even if you do not comment it was nice to have been heard i will try to save this for my mother to read later if there is a god why will not he let me die i can not live anymore i do not want to ask to be happy nor to be rich or anything i just want the pain to stop i can not keep going up and down on this rollercoaster ride i can not accept happiness because i know it will not last i can never stay in the moment my heart hurts all the time i just want some peace why can not i have that why do i have to be so different from the people around me i just want to go too happy to stay i am still getting over my clinical depression and things have gone fairly well now i just started my first real relationship i am 25 and things are ok but i am so afraid of going back to that lonely dark place where everything is hopeless that i would like to die now i feel like i have gotten what i asked for the brief moments of intimacy where you are truly comfortable and happy i just can not go back to the way i was i do not care if things could get even better or even worse i just want to stop right here right now and die with good feelings has anyone else felt this way before how do you deal with the loneliness i try to surround myself with people family and friends and go out to public places mostly on my own but even around people i can feel the loneliest please share some advice i feel like i am barely hanging on some days repeated i keep asking to die i do not want to i keep trying to live by throwing myself into hobbies socializing occasionally but it s not enough almost every night i ask to die because the pain and all the loneliness hits me again i have good friends and they know about my depression just like my family does and they have tried to help i feel so selfish and ashamed for not accepting the help that they offer or at least not being able to i can not just make myself feel better i know this pain is temporary but the if anyone has ever been in this situation they know that it s damn near intolerable i thought that i was making one good friend but i have to accept that he may have gotten tired of talking to me i just can not bare to start again i do not want to bother my family anymore with this and i do not want people to feel sorry for me anymore i just want it to end can anyone assure that this will one day go away maybe you get a reward for suicide i am clinically depressed and i think about leaving the world all the time just to escape the pain that my brain causes tonight the thought that s keeping me up is if there is a god maybe he she it really does not judge those that choose to take their own lives if you go by the belief that life is planned out and or that god knows you better than you know yourself then does not it seem like some people on this earth were just born to suffer if we who think about suicide continue to hold on maybe the majority of us will pull through as god intended but then again we all can not be special maybe some of us just were not built to rise above the pain and god knows this and maybe he rewards you for going out the way that you did our suffering creates compassion and may help some other poor soul but what about the suffering why should the horrible life and death of one person help many others yet that same person can not benefit from anyone else s compassion i think about starving children the holocaust other genocides repeated it does not make sense the randomness of the world and the mixture of blessings is confusing and infuriating i do not know how to change my thought process i can try but i can not help but think that if i get better if that indeed a part of god s plan what about those that do not and who were just dealt the wrong hand in life repeated you can play what you have all you want repeated but it does not change the fact that it s a shitty hand i guess i just want to help everyone including myself why should i get better while others get worse	d

15099	been feeling down stressed saw ex tonight and now wanting to die title explains the gist of things saw my ex tonight he a ftm transgender i am an otherwise cishet male was in a theatre performance in our hometown where he still lives for now so i came to see it as i promised i would a while ago we have not spoken in three weeks three fridays ago we left on a sour note after he canceled plans we had to get breakfast last minute besides the small spat the cancellation caused we d been on solidly good terms for several weeks a couple days later i sent him a text while i was playing a trivia game with some friends a question came up and i knew the answer but only because it was something he had told me a long time ago when we were still together since then i have half deliberately avoided any contact we have both been busy him with theatre me with school and both of us with life in general i had hoped tonight would be a refreshing moment because when last we spoke i think we both would have called ourselves great close friends still i went to see him when the show was over after saying hey to a few other people i knew there he came and offered a hug which i returned and the feelings rushed back into me again things i had not felt in a while and that i thought were all but gone and the thing about the hug was that i could tell that he felt nothing similar i tried to convey my excitement and happiness for his performance but it felt ill received as i was kinda pushed aside i thought i was past this i have gone out with and chatted up several other people in the past few weeks i felt like i was over him like i was whole again y know but after tonight i am not so certain i generally run pretty low emotionally speaking suicide is an almost daily consideration of mine i have a necklace with a charm that means a lot to me that i wear when i need an extra boost to get through my day i have not taken it off outside of showering in almost a month i keep poking my thumb on its pointed end to make sure it still hurts all i can think of is taking the pointed end somewhere else on my skin and just letting it destroy me i am not trying to sound poetic to make a statement but writing has always been one of my coping mechanisms in regards to my ex i feel like i still want to be with him more than anything if we can manage to just be best friends that s okay too especially since we d been just that for a couple of months without many complications no one has ever known or understood me my passions my dreams my quirks or my pain like he has did and at this moment i am still honestly convinced that nobody ever will i want to die i want to be done with all of this knowing that he either can not or simply will not be here to stop me i want to disappear that much more please if you have read this far and have any real and sincere advice to offer i am open to suggestions thanks for listening reddit not many others would 20 male hating myself the cycle of life i feel like my life is generally pretty alright in a broad sense i know that is not typical of a person with thoughts of suicide but maybe today is just one of my better days and having a decent life is also a part of why i want to end it some days if that makes any sense i will try to explain when things do start to pile up and drag me down which happens almost cyclically though i have not yet identified any trigger of sorts i usually turn to other friends who have similar issues or i look online for help what often happens is that i witness people feeling the same way that i do only over much worse i feel almost objectively circumstances it s then that i start to feel bad for feeling bad y know his problems are so much harder and more painful than mine yet here he is still would be something i say to myself often then i start to feel like a villain almost because i am contemplating suicide over what seem like trivial matters by comparison my point i suppose is that i have issues with seeing the good in my life and often feel very depressed over the bad then when i am reminded of the good i feel even worse for having let it go unnoticed and start to spiral further downward i am not fully certain what i am looking for i will gladly answer any questions about specific details if you think you can help with any of my problems for my basic problems however kiss how can i better see the happiness in life and appreciate it more if i am having troubles appreciating niceties should i consider being tested for depression or something similar part of my sadness stems from receiving little to no results from my hard work and efforts in a few different areas is this a sign i should give up or just keep fighting harder thanks and i hope you are doing okay yourself	b
15722	i am tired of everything and just want to end it all suicide sounds better and better everyday i seriously do not know what to do anymore all the time i constantly get bashed on by my parents for no reason my mom tells me i am retarded lazy and all these other terrible things i am always the first to blame for everything i do not remember the last time they did something or got me something i wanted i can not even remember the last time they told me i did a nice job on something or that they were proud of me i am also convinced everyone hates allcaps irl allcaps and virtually i am slowly drifting away from people i used to talk too because of internet i am just an annoying little piece of crap that causes drama everywhere i go i always get made fun of for what i do or what i like i have been told by multiple people that they do not care about me it s just gotten to the point where death feels like the best option	c
15807	i still want to die despite everything goign right in my life i have a job excess of money i work minimal wage and have 700 800 bucks spending money a month living in a awesome place good friends amazing fantastic violin teaching awesome co workers and i really do not care if i ended it i wish i had a gun because it gets bad enough that i decide to do it that day but of course that has not happen but it has happened in the past not shooting myself attempting suicide so i donno this is weird	c
38491	life sucks this is my first real use of reddit i was directed here by reddit s allcaps eve allcaps online community but basically here s my story my life has fallen apart this year i was asked to leave my first university where i was attempting to study engineering at the end of the summer i ended up breaking up with my now ex in a fit of fury and now i am studying flight at a school 1200 miles away from home i recently realized i still love her and am having the hardest time of my life trying to win her back i can not live like this anymore she hurts me so badly leading me on like we will see how things are when you come home for break etc etc yet she still claims she s free to do what she wants until then because i broke up with her and did not want to get back together while she still wanted to now i just keep praying that something will happen repeated maybe the prop will start inadvertently whilst i am inspecting it or who knows but it s something i have been thinking about for a while	c
38515	i almost ended it i know you probably do not want to hear from me i am 14 and i just want to be through with it i tied a belt around my neck but could not keep it due to the pain it caused i have been dissapointing everyone in my family and i wish i was never born my grades lowered my friends decreased and i am tired of how i treat myself i just want to sleep forever	d
38531	do the thoughts go away i usually post under throw away account when i am feeling low but today i feel fine my work day was all right i got to come home and relax and i sleep in tomorrow i have no reason to feel depressed and i have a lot of fun things coming up in 2015 but while i was cleaning a weird scenerio played out in my mind if i were to be at a roof top or with my head in a noose getting ready jump who would i call to talk me down could anyone what do i want to hear following this i reminded myself that i did not want to die and kept repeating that but the thought kept coming to mind sometimes i have a long day and i think about how long it would take to make a noose and how hard it would be to wrap it to a rafter other days i am reading a book and then it just pops into my mind that i should buy some rope just in case i have never practiced self harm and i have never truly attempted to kill myself but the thoughts will not stop i have come a long way since i was a teen but the thoughts are still there do they end or will i be in my forties contemplating the perfect way to jump	c

39496	elbowpatch is saying that he is terminal and is planning on suicide if any of you are inclined you may want to visit with him from r needadvice someone looking for support groups for depression thought you all might be able to help did not tell them that i cross posted here so i would greatly appreciate if you did not tell them happy kind of a heads up about another thread is there a r for people who are grieving right now this is the single most compassionate place that i know of yet there are those in need of support that are not necessarily suicidal i feel bad directing them to sw not because i think sw is a bad place but i do not want them to perceive my directing them this way as thinking they are suicidal thinking of suicide link to a needadvice thread	a
39656	hi should i go to a doctor medicine can be expensive and i am a minor so i do not want to tell my parents i can never concentrate on important things and procrastinate i always feel like killing myself and feel like i will never get anywhere in life and am wasting my parents money	c
39832	i flirt with suicide so i usually have a rather down disposition it s better at times than others but it s generally down my moods will bottom out and i just really do not feel like existing this last week it s just been like a hammer day after day and i can not really bring myself to want to live i had a wreck that i walked away from not too incredibly long ago i really wish i would have just been knocked out died peacefully in the wreck i walked away from it as though nothing happened and you could have died and holy shit you are so lucky to be alive is what i keep hearing repeated and i feel like it s a joke i have just felt so goddamn alone since then and it was manageable at first repeated but the truth is there are so many things that i can not change that bother me in life that i can not really understand what the point of going on is i do not want to be told oh it s going to be alright because i know it s not i am not where i want to be in life and it drives me crazy being where i want in life is currently beyond my grasp and that s not changing it s not only just that i lack hope for my situation to change even if i knew i only had to wait a little while that s not good enough i need things to change sooner now i am ready to just go and yet i am here where is the line between serious contemplation and idle passing thoughts this may be the wrong and if so i apologize but it did not seem proper to go into r suicidewatch i am curious as to where the line is drawn when discussing whether or not someone is suicidle this thought comes up because i have thought about it nearly daily for probably 10 + years i have on occassion been tempted to go through with whatever way seemed best at the time and i d be lying if i did not evaluate it as a viable option despite this train of thought i have never actually been able to convince myself to commit to the act nor have i ever been able to convince myself to quit thinking about it i have let a few people know over time i do think about it repeated but i can not figure out why i flirt with suicide so much yet never just do it i do not really fear death so i do not think that is it repeated i do not really care what it will do to my family hell i d love to watch the after math if not for the being dead part i have given plenty of thought to various means and methods and yet i still just flirt with it rather than doing something and i am really curious as to why repeated i am not planning anything as of now but it s something i have been wondering about lately anyone else experience this or have any insight	c

11388	as soon as my mum dies i am going to kill myself x post depression there s nothing that anyone can say or do that s going to change my mind on this for a long time i have wanted to just die and the only thing that s keeping me here is that i can not stand the thought of my mum crying over my corpse i am full of self hatred insecurities baggage and a complete fear of the world my friends do not care enough about me to stay engaged in any conversation hell almost all of them do not even live within distance to see them and now i just feel lonely all the time this entire revelation came about minutes ago when i was sitting in bed and my mind wandered back to all the shit people have put me through my entire school experience was one long line of people who wanted to bully and harass me my first girlfriend cheated on me with her best friend who she had no feelings for my second girlfriend emotionally abused me and bullied me for wanted her to treat me like her boyfriend and my third girlfriend who often told me that she had never loved anyone the way she loved me dumped me a week ago and was already in the arms of another guy the next day i do not know what it is about me that makes people want to be terrible to me but i can not deal with it any more i really really just can not i have been suffering from depression for my entire life and i think that my time is over when i have no one left who would cry when i die so i do not know what the point of this post is really i guess i just want to get it all out somewhere that i will not be called an idiot for being depressed i have sat for hours and tried to think of the positive moments of my life but all that ever comes to me is more bullying and awful moments that make me feel worse and worse about life i do not see there being a silver lining i can not even operate like a normal person because the world terrifies me my lifes dream is to just have a family and be surrounded by people who love me but my depression social fears distrust and emotional problems have made that dream completely unlikely i dunno i guess i am just saying that i do not want to live and do not see a point in trying any more edit thanks for downvoting me guys	c

11886	help my wife wants a divorce and despite all of the evil that she did i am heartbroken and do not know if i can take it this time around she s also speaking foul about me all over the internet what can i do i posted before about this but now the situation really hit rock bottom it seems as mentioned before i have allcaps ocd allcaps generalised anxiety disorder and depression which can turn clinical and i have had these problems since i was a child i will say the backstory again i met my wife through where else but we were friends back then she s 26 years old from spain and was dating a 65 year old man she spoke vile things about him to me and to many others then she left him and moved in with a 60 year old man the same thing happened i mention the age due to the difference but know that age does not always matter last year i suffered a broken ankle and since my family did not help as they are very wealthy and see me like a burden even with my brother and sister telling me to go kill myself and i am not joking she sent me funds from the uk which i accepted only after she insisted many times then i became bait one day she suddenly buys her ticket to where i live and we move in together every day she wrote me very long emails saying how she wants to be with me for eternity etc repeated i knew that she had a pretty extreme way of thinking as she s pretty much a militant vegan believes that she will live to be at least 200 and is not human but from an extraterrestrial species no joke i did not know that she was being very serious about these last two points and she seemed pretty sane when she said that i was very emotionally vulnerable back then and accepted her coming over here then hell ensued she would throw a tantrum every other day tried to control me in every way she could i could not get a haircut i could only wear shorts sandals and a t shirt i had to eat exactly what she ate etc repeated i could not call my friends from within the house because she would hear everything the situation got so bad that i started drinking heavily and gambling and i am not addicted to either the latter i stopped completely but i still have a couple of whiskeys or beers now and then just to forget anyway this girl is clearly not emotionally mentally stable in any sense the foul things she tells me are horrible i have never been told that your family had to stand you all your life poor them or i can not believe how your job put up with you for so many years these words hurt horribly and despite this i still love her or i think i do and now she wants to file for divorce as i did not change the way she wanted me to in 1 year we have been married for about 5 months i feel guilty i started smoking more drinking more etc repeated because she was making me lose my mind or because i let her make me lose my mind she had huge tantrums one in particular where she started banging the walls and screaming like she was possessed after i told her peacefully that i felt like ending myself that this is too much everybody advised me to call the police i did not now she s abroad and extended her trip until the 6 th she claims to be asexual and i know asexual people i went through an asexual phase myself and she s anything but that she s probably getting laid by somebody else and this thought rips me to pieces because if there was one good thing in our relationship it was sex once a month or once every two months that s when one feels closer to the partner and it s horrible to think this right now she s probably fucking some guy on her trip and writing vile things about me to everybody i never ever did anything wrong to her my conscience is clear on the other hand she destroyed me yet i still have feelings for this person i feel used and trampled on and the thought of her writing to a whole bunch of people maybe even my more normal family members made me literally vomit i have a history of overdosing and once i almost jumped off a building now that i have the apartment to myself i feel like tying this nuzzle to the roof and just ending it but i can not pull through the act i married her to rebuild my trust in people as i have been used over and over agaii i thought it would be different this time around people let me down constantly and i am scared shitless of hurting myself beacuse it s been 35 years of hell any advice would be welcome and no i am not trying to play the victim i am on medication but do not have time to see a therapy due to all of the working hours help i think that my catastrophic thoughts will send me send me to a very bad place and i need some advice hello you have all probably heard the same story before but my situation is really a life and death one i am currently at work and seriously obsessing about a series of situations that could send me to the grave i have been diagnosed with allcaps ocd allcaps generalised anxiety and depression which can turn clinical i have compulsive behavior where i overspend and i fear people will hate me for it no it s not cheating or drug addiction or anything bad done to anybody else save myself but i can not say what it is out fear if being discovered i take clonazepam and cymbalta for my condition but i find myself still worrying a lot about what could happen if i am discovered like if my wife finds out that i owe money to a lady we both know and can not pay her back or if she calls her and tells her about the debt and she throws me out of her life to sum it up i need some tips on how to control my catastrophic thoughts that i will end up on the street and without a wife i obsess about this constantly and it s starting to get in the way of my work where i live it s difficult to find a psychiatrist who can give therapy and they are very expensive i have attempted ending it before with tranquilizer overdoses and this time around i feel like i have no escape my father helps me out but his help is very limited almost nothing save for the medication he also lent me a bit of money a while ago and i can not pay him back and he expects me to and i fear him not getting the medication due to this if anybody can help or give any tips on it would be much appreciated thank you	c

44656	giving myself an ultimatum hey so i am a 22 year old guy who is basically a loser in the years since i graduated from high school i have accomplished absolutely nothing i went through a period of depression and self pity that made me seriously ruin my life i am taking far too long to finish at university i am addicted to porn and masturbation and sitting infront of my laptop all day i can not drive i am broke i have friends that i am too afraid to see because of my horrid social phobia and anxiety i literally become a mute infront of strangers i also took a hard long look at myself in the mirror today and realised that my body is disgusting i have become skinny fat 0 muscle on my body but a shit load of fat on my gut thighs ass and on my moobs man boobs one day on vacation my older brother by a year quite literally told me i was a worthless waste of space and he was ashamed to be seen with me he s everything i want to be successful popular with girls social well groomed muscular stylish and i really look up to and admire the guy repeated so it really was a hard blow when he said that to me 6 months ago after my dad kicked me out the house for failing the semester i set out to improve my life its been 6 months and still no improvement i failed my drivers test i am failing my exams as hard as i try i still cant stop watching and jerking off to porn and despite my diet and work out i have gained little to no muscle and still have a gut still no job i still spend my weekends in my room on my laptop watching videos all day with the curtains drawn in fantasy land and now my mother hates me because she knows her son that she invested 22 years of her life in is a failure repeated i feel like nothing will change until i give myself an incentive so heres the deal im giving myself until the 2 8 th of september my 2 3 rd birthday to get my shit together if by then i am still 7 0 kg s of fat who is broke sexless and can not drive then i will commit suicide i figure if i cant at least achieve one of these things i might as well take the burden off my mother and everyone else who s life i either affect negatively or not at all i am lonely and right now if i cant change anything then i might as well off myself anyways peace	c

45437	eah it s 2 am the fans gently blowing a noise that distract the hallowed emptiness inside the cool air gently breezing through the blanket over my head as i lay here typing on a flat non tactile surface each key feels the same without emotion or characteristic the corner of my eye sees the stitching of my plushies nose probably put together by a 12 year old in china so i have not posted here in a long while i have i general been having it pretty good but we all have our off days today being one of them my girlfriend is coming over in the morning probably about 6 hours from now witch is why i should be sleeping so i am not a zombie when she comes over but my heart has sunk deep down inside me tonight making ever so tempting to self harm though i will not because if i do i will have to own up to my actions it s not easily hide able when you have someone close to you i bought mariokart last night myself and two other friends stayed up until 4 in the morning playing and racing one other having a blast i even kinda forced one of them to watch frozen but he enjoyed it in the end overall that was a good day with my friends but today i have just myself sure i was texting my girlfriend and enjoying some music and what not there was that voice in my head that voice that tells you to worry to judge yourself the one that stops you from playing games like kart because they arant productive at the same time the same voice tells you to stop drawing or being creative because your not good at it i currently am doing nothing i do not work i do not go to school last year i dropped out of school because of my anxiety and depression and get help going to get medication and learning about my illness this september i am going back to school for something a little bit different and a little bit closer to home this time though i will have to take a bus to and from school witch i dread the idea of the idea of giving my control up to the schedual that the bus is on to wake up early in the morning an leave late at night like i said i do not work in march i was feeling pretty good and wanted to search for a job i did not necessarily want to get one but i wanted to go threw the interview process a couple of times and get my confidence up i went to a local government program that helps the unemployed get jobs great someone to help me out i let them know i want part time 2 days a week kinda thing just something easy to make a little money and meet some people there like sure we can help you awesome we make up my resume and during the next few weeks get in contact with 2 employers one i was kind of excited for and i got a interview but within 1 0 minutes the lady was like whoops looks like we have an issue you only want two days a week and your going back to school we need a minimum of 4 days a week the government place already knows that bye bye maybe i am summarizing but it s my story the other guy did not like people with long hair i dunno i feel like time is such a precious thing and we all waste so much of it what is truly important repeated and eah girls are so hard to understand and i do not want september to come yesterday felt like march repeated eah blea repeated just a down day been on medications and feeling a lot better over last few months but today is just one of those days where you just want to die repeated annoyed a bumpy road to recovery i dunno what i am really doing right now it s 2 am and i just feel alone right now i use to browse this everyday for months on end cutting myself wanting to die but after a brief moment of self realization just before an actually suicide attempt i decided to get help i am on medication now and reading repeated or trying to read some books when i say try i mean want to read but sorta avoid the idea of it i have stop cutting everyday almost entirely until the other night in the shower but far less than i use to to be honest i dunno why im typing this i guess just too keep my mind occupied from the loneliness tonight i need help motivating myself to do stuff repeated	b

3058	i have destroyed my life fuck it might as well write something not even sure why guess i am still hoping for some sort of miracle it s not like i am a big fan of the whole dyeing thing but for the past few months i just felt like there is no other way for the last few years my life has been nothing short of hell a college dropout with absolutely no skills no job or hope of ever finding one i have been living with almost no income for 2 years now and the little money i have been able to earn from the little work i found here and there was at no point enough for even rent and bills let alone anything else for 2 whole years i have not had a decent meal most of them consisted of several slices of bread + just a little something to make it bearable i can not even remember the last time i bought a peace of clothing shoes repeated it s just tiring eating same old disgusting food day after day wearing the same old worn out clothes shoes with countless holes in them that you could smell from meters away not being able to go out for a drink with friends repeated just 2 god damn years without a single good thing happening to me a single thing to brighten up my day nothing but 24 hours a day of anxiety worrying depression suicidal thoughts those things take a toll on a person both physically and mentally my health has deteriorated and with no health insurance i have not even been able to afford a visit to a doctor i have lost about 2 0 kg and i am currently down to 60 mental part is even worse than physical constant anxiety and feeling of impending doom almost having a heart attack every time someone rings a doorbell or i receive a phonecall repeated no person should live like this i have alienated myself from most of my friends but feeling like shit and not having any money have not given me the opportunity to hang out much the only one i still see everyday is my best friend roommate who i am afraid has also grown to resent me because of the money i borrowed from him about a year ago and still have not been able to repay to make things ever worse i am several months behind on rent and bills and today should finally be the day i get kicked out and left with nothing i do not know what to do i just can not live like this anymore i have tried taking my life before pills did absolutely nothing and i could not grow ball to jump off the building finally got some rope but just my luck i do not even have a place to tie it to and hang myself no idea what to do next the very thought of ending my life scares the shit out of me but i can not take one more day of this	d

3434	bored to death life is over rated suicidal just spent 4 agonizing and boring hours and i kept thinking how life was over rated how life sucks and is boring most of the time and how the negative aspects of life outweighed the positives i was very miserable the whole time i was at work and if i had an a button that i could press which would kill me instantly and painlessly i would have pressed it with no hesitation it s not like i had nothing to do with work i was actually working too slowly and the work was piling up came home and saw my dog just sitting there on the couch not moving at all business as usual i love my dog more than anything in the world seeing this just made me more depressed and reinforced my belief in life being over rated i am not so bored now browsing the web but i would still hit that if i could i d say right now i am slightly bored i could play some video games to entertain me but i have got other shit to take care of the only real obstacle to me committing suicide right now is that i do not have the means to i have some kitchen knives that i can use to slit my carotid artery but i am too afraid of pain i heard having your heart stop beating is a nice way to die you just lose consciousness and eventually you are gone sounds nice to me	c

40148	i think my problem is me i do not know how to fix it before i go on i want to make it clear that i do think about suicide but i do not think that i will go through with it in the near future right now i am just desperate for some advice and insight because i have no where else to turn i have always had issues making friends always ever since i was in elementary school i would make friends and then lose them or not make any at all i always blamed not making friends on my shyness and not keeping friends on other people just being assholes i think that that was true in elementary school but i am not so sure about beyond that in elementary school i actually had 3 friends that at different points in time were my best friends then one day they all decided that they were too cool for me i am not sure if your elementary school was anything like mine but even back then cliques were already forming i remember clearly that 2 of them turned from me because i wasn t accepted into the popular group the first one i was friends with for a few years and then one she left and came back when she came back i was sitting at lunch one day and said her name to get her attention so i could talk to her and she said allcaps what allcaps like oh my god why are talking to me voice then the second one was friends with me for a year and then the next year when we came back to school i went to talk to her at recess and she literally twisted her face up at me and gave me a weird look like what are you doing talking to me i will never forget that that one hurt the most tbh the third one was because she was completely selfish by the time i was in middle school i had switched schools because we moved out of state i had issues making friends i think because of my shyness i made some good friends there i actually really miss it however i spent all my summers and most of my weekends by myself at home on the computer at the end of my 8 th grade year we moved back to the same county as before i was forced to make new friends with people that i had already failed to make friends with before i made a group of friends that got me through high school but again i spent my summers and most of my weekends by myself alone repeated on the computer and it really upset me because this group of friends would spend all kinds of time together over the summer and on weekends but would never invite me they would even make elaborate plans in front of me but never even think to invite me it really hurt my feelings now i am in college my freshman year i lived on campus i went out of my way to talk to people during orientation and say hi and everything because i really wanted to establish a group of friends i was really determined well then i found myself half way through orientation week with no group of friends while everyone else had a group i mean sure they probably were not close life long friends but they at least had something to lean on considering everyone there was new to each other i felt so lost it s a small school btw i became friends with my roommate we are still friends and we talk on facebook and hang out sometimes but sometimes i feel like she just talks to me because she s somewhat in the same boat that i am at school we have each other and another girl from china which i do not seem to click with that well not sure why she s super sweet though there s nothing wrong with her except my roommate seems to have people in class that she can talk to for help and whatever or just small talk while i do not i sit in class take notes leave i will be a junior this year and the same thing happened last year except i do not live on campus anymore work is another hell story when i first started at my first job i liked it i thought i got along with everybody then i found out from a fellow employee about 6 months later that this guy that i thought i was cool with was talking massive shit behind my back and she made it sound like him talking shit was actually making other people hate me she started after me and worked with him before she worked with me and she admitted to me that she never gave me a chance and felt sorry about it because she was wrong and then she told me that he was saying that i was lazy and blah blah blah which is not even true she said that she s gotten a few people to realize that what he was saying was bullshit although i still feel like those people still hate me but that there s this one girl that she can not get to change her mind which was really weird to me because i had never worked with that girl so i did not know why she did not like me well there was a lot of drama with her long story short she changed the schedule so she d get more hours than me i just feel like after that i can not trust anybody there the people that i thought i was on good terms with now i feel like are actually talking behind my back but never saying it to my face i just do not know what to say and then i got a second job and i have worked 2 shifts and hate it the workers are not very friendly or helpful i have had a couple talk to me but it s very superficial and they do not seem interested at all i will probably end up quiting my second job but i can not quit my first because i get 27 hours there which i desperately need to pay for my phone my car loan and my gas to get back and forth to school about 100 miles a day the only support system i really have is my boyfriend but when i try to talk to him about this stuff he s not all that helpful he does not know how to deal with it i mean he s a loving guy but he just does not get it all he says is you just need to be happy my sister is never home and she s too involved in her friends lives to genuinely care about what i have to say i try to hold a conversation with her and before i can finish what i have to say she s got her nose in her phone i try talking to my mom everyday about just simple things that went on in my day but all she does is look at me and then look away without saying anything or she just does not even look at me at all i have tried addressing this several time but she either ignores it or tells me i am being overdramatic i have told her once i wanted to kill myself and i literally got yelled at in my face for it i can not talk to my dad because he s just not someone i can go to about this stuff and my brother and i hate each other i am just absolutely desperate for help please somebody respond i feel so stupid and helpless	c
40240	how do i tell my spouse that his porn use is pushing me over x posted to r relationshipsthere is so much defense of porn around but i honestly can not handle it it s a deal breaker for me and i think i am allowed to set my own boundaries so before everyone tries to convince me that porn is ok and it does not change how he feels about me repeated just stop i have heard it all before i have turned it around in my head a million times i have analysed it from every perspective and ultimately i am just not ok with it it hurts me and i am entitled to that feeling he s looking at girls who are younger slimmer more beautiful than i can ever be he told me he would stop the first time he said i did not realise that it hurt you so much i promise i will stop then repeated i find he s been doing it again i can understand the first time he said he did not know it hurts me but now he knows and he still did it he allcaps willingly allcaps goes and does something that he allcaps knows allcaps hurts me i am not coping and i am having thoughts of putting myself out of my own misery how can i tell him	b
40671	i am unable to find any concrete reasons to live i do not want to sound overly dramatic but i do not really have any good reasons to stay alive its not that i particularly want to die i just do not want to keep living either i do not have any friends to care about and i do not get along with my family my life is not exactly in shambles but i do not really have any long term goals or anything more i want to achieve in life i have some hobbies they are ok nothing to write home about i can not really come up with any reasons why i should keep living	c
40938	hey sw i have never really been here before but i need your advice concerning a friend i really hope this is the right place for this repeated here goes note the friend in question lives 1500 miles away before anyone asks as i run over the events of tonight i keep feeling worse about it a friend of mine has had a pretty rough life the last few years let me preface this by saying she does not trust people and hardly lets anyone in two years ago she was held hostage in her own home as they were robbed and things with her now ex boyfriend started to sour because she was unable to cope with the robbery eventually they ended up breaking up a year later after this happened she started to slip into darkness she had suicidal thoughts and actions the only person she ever really loved threw her out she and i were not in touch at this point because she made a kind of crazy agreement with him that she would not talk to other guys if he agreed not to talk to other girls she was quite the jealous type fast forward to more recent times she was doing better but definitely not doing well she had made progress but she still wasn t completely normal whatever that really means she still pined over her ex unrealistically hoping that he d take her back even though he made it clear he had no intention of dating her or anyone else for a long time i tried to do my best as a friend to support her though i made it clear that she should probably begin to move on two to three weeks ago they met and had lunch eventually the topic of getting back together came up and he lashed out at her and made it painfully obvious that they would not date yet even with this she refused to believe that they would not get back together fast forward to last week after some huge blowout he finally cut ties completely with her needless to say she did not take it well and i ended up having to pick up the pieces she voiced her desire to kill herself i tried to talk her down but when that failed i suggested that she call a suicide hotline she called and the lady talked her down and she was okay i got her to see a therapist four days ago the only friend she had left at her university turned her back on her and made it clear that they could never be friends again my friend does not take it well but she s more angry than anything which is completely reasonable immediately after it happens she is bawling her eyes out and crying over the phone as we talked i let her know that i care about her a lot and that i am there for her and after about forty five minutes of talking she s doing much better she has thoughts of killing herself because she feels alone but she s able to stifle them with help from her therapist okay so fast forward to tonight my friend is not able to think rationally she is a complete wreck she prefaced our conversation with the statement that she is considering killing herself tonight at first i just tried to talk her down but there wasn t a shred of rationality in her tonight a suicide hotline would not even do it my friend had been cutting herself all night superficially citing it is the only way she copes she said that she had her pills at her side and was cutting more to prepare for tonight at this point i decide to call her campus pd i could not live with myself if she had killed herself and i did nothing so i acted about half an hour later they get to her dorm and talk her down and take her to the psych hospital i feel like i did the right thing but i feel like i betrayed her confidence and i keep feeling worse about it as time progresses but that aside how am i to help my friend	a
