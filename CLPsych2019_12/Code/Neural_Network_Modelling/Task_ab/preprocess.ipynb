I just want to talk and stuff. Ugh...everything is just so hard. School is very hard for me for some reason and I\\'m probably going to fail. I really hate it. Everyone else seems to be so happy, and I\\'m just the quiet antisocial guy and no one really seems to care about me much there.At home it is really hard because first of all, there are a lot of arguments that go on. That makes me sound weak but it actually affects me. And also my mom likes to make fun of me. She only seems to care about how I do in school. Everyone wants me to \"like and respect\" her but I haven\\'t felt any love or respect for her in years. Everyone thinks that that\\'s bad but they don\\'t know what it\\'s like for me. I overthink and I feel bad about everything. I get anxious whenever I\\'m close to being happy and I think about everything that\\'s wrong and I just start to feel bad. I can\\'t help but worry about everything that happens. I am so unmotivated. I can\\'t do any work or anything. Mostly when I\\'m at home, all I do is lay down in my bed and think and I don\\'t do any work. So it must be my fault because I don\\'t really try, I want to die too much I think.I do have things I like. I have some hobbies like writing and drawing (but I\\'ve been too unmotivated to do either recently). I do have a dream of what I want to do in the future. I have some friends. But maybe those things are becoming less and less effective. The pain is just increasing.I\\'ve decided that the only way out of this constant pain and depression is to die. I wish I didn\\'t have to. The few people that care would be destroyed. And I won\\'t be able to do all the stuff that I like or want to do. So I can somewhat see a point in living. But the thing is, every time I get happy, it always goes away. I just want to be happy like everyone else!! Is that really too much to ask? Do I just deserve to feel bad like this? That\\'s what it\\'s starting to feel like. I\\'m really tired of fighting. I would cry, but for some reason I can\\'t cry anymore. That feels really horrible to have to hold in my feelings like this I really want to just cry and let it all out. I want to get help. I want to talk to people. But I\\'m really antisocial and I can\\'t talk to people and I hate myself for it. And when I do try to talk to people they usually ignore me or forget about me. This is all too much for me‚Ä¶if things don\\'t get better soon I\\'m going to attempt suicide. I just want it all to be over forever. And nothing ever helps. Dying is the only way to make it better. Please convince me otherwise because I don\\'t want to have to do this. I knew this post would be confusing‚Ä¶sorry for being such a burden. You don\\'t have to read all of this, I just care that you listened. Even if you don\\'t read it all or you can\\'t help me with this, thank you so much because you listened and cared.

I don\\'t want to call the suicide hotline because I\\'m really really scared of calling people because of anxiety, and im scared they\\'ll track me down or something and throw me in the mental hospital. I\\'m like 3 months clean from self harm and I don\\'t really wanna go back down that road. And there\\'s no way I can wait another 4+ years because I\\'ve been waiting for most of my life. So now i\\'m deeply thinking about suicide again. I say it on a bunch of different posts and its the same thing, only it gets worse every day. and I try to talk about it but people just keep saying to talk to therapists and \"just keep trying\" and stuff like that. I did attempt suicide in march, and it should\\'ve worked, but unfortunately it didn\\'t. But if I end up trying again, then ill certainly make sure that it works. But as I said I don\\'t want to die, I want to escape, and suicide is the only way out. So I really really want to know, if there\\'s anyone who knows how I can escape, please help me. And I actually want to escape, not to just \"go to a therapist\" or \"get accommodations/medicine/something to do\" or \"just keep talking to people\" because that\\'s what I\\'ve been fucking trying to do for a while, and it hasn\\'t been getting me anywhere. Whatever it may be that would help me, I\\'d need it to be pretty soon, because I\\'m far too tired of waiting.

Im apathetic to how my family would feel if I did it. I guess the real reason why I wanna do it is because of my outlook on life, which is: life is filled with ups and downs(for most people including me) and I guess Im too lazy to deal with the responsibilities of an adult, to me I\\'d rather just be \"asleep\" forever. To the people who want to say: it will get better etc., so what? I won\\'t be alive to regret it, ignorance is truly bliss', 'label': 'c'}\n",

Sit down comfortably, take some tea, and start wishing you could be somewhere else.I was born in a disfunctionnal family. My father is an Alcoholic and suffers from Bipolar Disorder, both things that heavilly runs into his familly. My mother is ALSO from a familly of Alcoholic, and while she is not one herself, she is what is called \"co-dependant\", aka dependant of the Alcoholic person. Needless to say, both of them grew up in disfunctionnal famillies as well, and raised us as they had been: Never taking us seriously(including never giving us any supports), Extremely variable discipline(going from a total disinterest to dictator wannabee), occasionnally even being physically abusive. They ALWAYS loved us, but as they themselves admitted, they were nowhere near ready to have children, and it is extremely difficult to raise your children properly when you\\'ve never experienced it yourself. I\\'m the second of three children; I have an older sister, who is doing great for herself. She left the mess of our home at 16 to join the Canadian army; she is well ranked, is married (to a fellow officer) and has a wonderful familly. Better yet, she was able to avoid the mistake my parents did, and her children are the best behaved, happiest children in the entire world. I couldn\\'t love them more.I also have a younger brother, concieved mere months after I was born. I suspect he is an Alcoholic, much like my father, but he\\'s doing rather well for himself. He\\'s had his rough time, but he has a job he\\'s extremely qualified at, has his own plot of land, deep in the forest, where my parents now live, and he will soon build himself a home there as well.Then there\\'s me, the failure of the family. I was always the Black Sheep in a familly of Black Sheeps ; From my most tender age, I knew what I wanted: To not be like them. I said I would never, EVER touch alcohol. That I would have a succesful life. But nobody believed me, because I was a bundle of problem : I had a form of Social Retardation(not intellectual, just social), ADHD, _PERSON_ anxiety(from birth), and was extremely sensitive. I acted wierd, and everybody knew it, especially at school. I was kind and wanted nothing more than to love and be loved, but the childrens took mad pleasure in torturing me instead. Physical and mental violence, insults, even sexual harrasment, were all \"normal\" things for me, growing up. I knew it wasn\\'t right, but I couldn\\'t do anything. My parents were powerless to help me, as they were either entangled in their own problems, or prevented from doing anything by everyone else around. The schools I went to prefered to blame them and myself for the bullying rather than the _PERSON_\\'s good to point that my brother and sis were both social butterfly). Whenever they\\'d have an intervention with the bullies, they\\'d focus about freaking racism, despite the fact that this was in NO way part of the _PERSON_ am white, so were all of my tormentors, and as far as I know the single black kid at school never had any issues). Psychologist and such were a joke, they were convinced I was simply paranoid, were 100% ready to diagnose me as such. Even after my mother gave testimony of many acts of bullying she had been a witness of, they merely gave me a belated diagnosis of anxiety and called it a day.Needless to say, such a childhood mess you up, bad. On top of everything I already had, I developped Borderline Personality Disorder(a complete instability of emotions). Teachers and school officials had more reasons to hate me, because I had extremely intense, violent outburst, from bottling up too much(as my councellors adviced me to. Get stronger! Harden yourself! Don\\'t show any emotions, they\\'ll bully you even more!!). I never hurt anyone else. But in their mind, I OBVIOUSLY was about to. I had always DREAMED of studying, and despite my ADHD, I was a great student, curious and so always eager to learn. But I had to leave school when I eventually had a long-coming mental breakdown. Mental health \"specialist\" were no help. I ended up rebuilding my mental psyche by myself, as best as I could. But the damage was long-done.I\\'ve been wandering ever since then, trying, and failling, to build myself a life worth living. I\\'m now 27, and it\\'s always been the same scenario: Whenever I think something is going right, either my mental disorders, or an outside agent, comes to wreck everything up. I\\'ve improved a lot for many of my mental trouble, but handling all of them leaves me absolutely drained, and I\\'m still very vulnerable to relapse. Being so drained all the time, I have difficulties with jobs. I should be handling my own schedule, working when I feel good, but I find myself forced to work when I\\'m already drained, draining me even further. I WANT to be my own boss, I have the skills required to become a farmer, today, right now. I studied for that, I adore working with plants, and know that as long as I respect my limit, I could make myself a decent living. I\\'d never be rich, but independance is all that I desire. But I cannot.First, because I have no money. I\\'m struggling to pay off debts I got trying (and failling) to improve my life. Second, because I have no support. Recently when I had an opportunity to go back to school to work on my farming skills, my father flat out told me to \"Stop dreaming and start being happy with what you have\". I was discouraged and did what he said. I now have lost my job because the tomato green house I am/was working at is not producing enough tomatoes, and they don\\'t make enough profit to keep my job(and others) anymore. I have NOTHING in front of me.I have a boyfriend who adores me, but I cannot help but feel he should run away and save himself before I inevitably ruins his life as well. I have pets I love (all rescues), but I can\\'t help but feel I am neglecting them. It\\'s hard to get yourself to empty the cat\\'s litter box when you\\'re too depressed to even shower and feed yourself. I am about 10k in debts, which may not seem like much but is a fortune when you\\'re not able to work more than part time, if at all. Everyone encourage me to live, but it\\'s hard when no matter where you look, what you do, you end up in deep shit. I am a good person. I don\\'t drink, just like I said when I was a kid. I don\\'t do drugs, don\\'t smoke. I do my best to pay off my debts. But nothing\\'s working. I don\\'t know if I would have the guts to just off myself, I\\'m too scared of hurting those I love. But there are time, very, very frequent time, where I wish I could just leave everything behind, get myself a cabin somewhere lost in the deepest corner of the planet, and see how long I could survive away from everything, from everyone. At least there I\\'d have a chance of survival. Not so with this slow agony that is my \"life\".', 'label': 'b'}\n",

I\\'ve been thinking about suicide for awhile, on and off for months. but lately, it\\'s been more frequent more reaccuring and the logic of it all seems to be pointing more and more towards just showing myself out the door. I don\\'t know what to do, i don\\'t know how to drag myself out of this hole, but i know the booze, and the cigarettes, and the weed aren\\'t helping. They\\'re only band-aids. and the cost more money than i have to spend. I\\'m 21, Male, and i guess i\\'d say i\\'m suicidal because there just doesn\\'t seem anything left to do.

I have a constant sense of dread and doom and don\\'t feel like anything that I can do will change that. I feel like a burden, even as i\\'m typing this, my plea for help i just keep thinking to myself \"Clayton, be a man, leave these people alone so they can help someone who needs it.\" and i don\\'t know how to sit down and say \"help me, please, i\\'m so scared.\" I threw away the woman i proposed to because of our lond distance relationship, i was content but not happy. I got into a whirlwind relationship with a woman, we moved into this apartment, got that cat over there, and then she left me for another man a week after we paid our first months rent. That was in February, i dropped out of college to pay my bills, re-enrolled in summer classes and am trying to look forward to my fall schedule. But, i can\\'t. I look at my schedule and all i see is stress and bills and lack of time for everything.I just want release. I don\\'t want to face my family and friends or be a burden, and honestly it\\'s the idea of them having to bury me and take care of all the bills and junk that i\\'ll leave behind that has always stopped me. Sure, i\\'ll get release from my bills, but someone will have to pay them, someone will have to take care of my cat, someone ... and it\\'s just the idea of forcing my problems on to other people that i can\\'t stand. and i don\\'t want to live anymore, but if i die i\\'ll be even more of a burden than i already am. So i have to suck it up and keep trying to make ends meet that are never going to.I\\'ll answer a few questions that i think are going to be posed before i wrap this book up. I can\\'t move in with my mom due to issues involving the adoptio of my newphew and his serious medical condition they cannot accept me back in with them. I have friends i could couch surf with but only for a few weeks at a time. I already live in low income housing and am food stamps to try to support myself. all of my bills are non-negotiable and i\\'ve tried to shift things as much as possible to take some of the stress off but so far with no real change in anything. In fact, i have a therapist but i cannot justify the co-payment for an appointment, the last time i got sick the co-payment for a doctors visit and meds made me miss my electric bill, that\\'s how tight my finances are. yea... so, i\\'m tempted to delete all this just so i don\\'t bother you, but i think it\\'s time someone, anyone, knew what keeps me up at 4 am.', 'label': 'c'}\n",

My name is Reece.I have been suffering from severe clinical depression for at least 3 years, maybe longer, probably longer.  I cut myself a lot.  I actually just relapsed after being clean for 9 months.  9 fucking months, thrown away.  I met a girl about a year and a half ago that always helps me through everything, and just over 9 months ago I asked her out (because her and I were honestly almost 100% similar) and she said yes.  I asked her just before I stopped cutting and she stopped around the same time too.  She\\'s still strong and hasn\\'t had even a thought of self harm again, but I just started doing it again about a week ago and she doesn\\'t know yet.  I did it for a while before we were together too, she thinks I haven\\'t done it since then.Anyway. _PERSON_ with the relationship stuff.She\\'s really the only person that cares, and I ALWAYS feel I am bothering her or annoying her whenever I am telling her about how I feel.  Every single time.  There is only one other person I can talk to and I also feel I bother this person.  I often just sit alone and keep everything to myself.  I feel ugly, I feel annoying, I feel unwanted, I feel alone, I know I let everyone down, I hate myself, and so on.  I have felt this way for so long, I can\\'t even remember.  No one supports me at all.  Everyone in my school either avoids me or says something about how I should go kill myself or how I am a faggot or whatever.  That really doesn\\'t help.  I have terrible anxiety and terrible trust issues.  I hurt everyone around me due to that.  My parents and brother don\\'t know about this, they thought I just had minor issues in the past.  They all know I used to cut, but again, none of them know I relapsed.  They all think I am happy and they all think I am doing better, but I\\'m not.  I can\\'t remember the last time I was truly happy.  Whenever I feel a little better or I feel decent, there is always something that will fuck it up.  Every single time.  Someone says something, someone does something, whatever.  Literally every time there is something to ruin my \"happiness\".  I put on a fake smile every single day.  No one knows that. _PERSON_ of people try to communicate with me or say something to me and honestly I don\\'t want anything to do with them because they are all fake.  I am told very often I am worthless, people always stare at me awkwardly, I always hear people talking about me, even in public, all of the religious fucks at my school tell me I\\'m going to hell for this and that, I\\'m not really religious at all but that\\'s just annoying.  There are so many people that can say they hate me and I only have two people to ever go to about my problems.  Other people say they will be there but they end up screwing me over.  For example, this one girl I used to be friends with.  I won\\'t say her name.  Her and I would talk to each other often, whenever we were feeling down, and I thought she was a friend.  I later found out she would talk about me behind my back, she would post my secrets on facebook and tumblr and she would spread everything, she would lie to me about a lot, you get it.  That\\'s happened a few times, actually.  I only trust my girlfriend.  Only her, no one else.  I\\'ve been taken advantage of, I\\'ve been beaten up, you name it.  _PERSON_ guys have tried to rape me, for fuck\\'s sake.  I am often told by people that somehow found out about my issues (probably from that girl I just mentioned) and they say it\\'s all a lie because I\\'m not a girl.  They think only girls can be sad and cut themselves and starve themselves, they are so fucking blind.  I could go on and on about these people.  Anyone who says they are here for me is a big fucking liar.  No one else that I call a \"friend\" even has the slightest idea of how I am.  I could go on and on and on about my shitty life, but I think I will stop soon.  I have left a lot unsaid.  I haven\\'t had any thoughts or attempts of suicide in a while, but tonight that\\'s different.  I am seriously on edge right now.  I hate this stupid fucking hell that I call my life.  I am seriously going to scream if someone generically says \"oh it will get better\", that\\'s probably the biggest lie I have ever heard.Sorry for the long post.', 'label': 'c'}\n",

I'm 17 and I finished my Senior year of High School 1 year early. I'm the middle child and the only boy. Starting when I was about 5 (I cannot quite remember the age, I just remember I was really young) I would go to my friends house across the street of my grandmas to play the Ocarina of Time and YuGiOh, it was fun from what I remember but what I didn't realize is that my friend was making me do inappropriate things to one kid, and he also sexually abused me in a way. He'd bring his friend over from around the block, and pull his pants down. He'd make me touch his friend and he'd do things do him too. Eventually he would watch porn and make me touch him. He removed my pants and did things to me too. I don't remember what happened but I just kinda stopped going over there. Its a blur. Then a year or two later the kid down the street from my house who is a year younger than me convinced me into sexual activity under my bed. Of course I didn't know this was wrong considering I was so young. I guess everyone experiments. Even the kid a few houses down that was way older than me got involved. Once I realized what we were doing was wrong I took myself out of the equation, and that has stuck with me since. Around the same time this was happening my dad started drinking more and became physically abusive towards me exclusively as i'm the middle child and the only boy my parents had. He couldn't beat my sisters so I guess I was the outlet. He would yell at me and throw me against a fence. Sometimes he would throw chairs at me and kick me in the head, sometimes he would punch me. He stomped my chest one time when I was watching Pokemon in the morning when I was around 10. He kept this up until I was 15 and then we moved. It was supposed to be a fresh start for the family but my dad is still a drinker, and he verbally abuses me on a constant basis. He makes inquiries that i'm gay when I really don't know what my sexuality is. I don't think I will know, its very foggy to me considering the events i've detailed. This is the first time i've told anyone about this. In school a gay kid (he came out) started rumors that I was gay too. The rumor's continued from middle school even through my junior year. No action was ever taken against the kids who kept making fun of me. One time a girl tried to take a metal pen and scratch gay in capitals into my arm, so I grabbed the pen off my desk and just flung my arm back, it caught her in the eye. I got in more trouble than she did, eventually in Intermediate we became friends though. The kid who started the rumors never apologized to me, he used to be my close friend. My little cousin approached me one day and started touching me inappropriately and I didn't know what to do, I was in shock. I hate thinking about these things, but it is was my childhood was and I don't know what to do with my life.I've been rejected by almost every girl i've spoken too despite them leading me on. I try and take my mind off these things by playing video games, watching movies/tv, and reading comics, but I don't know how l long I can do this for. My parents haven't prepared me to leave out on my own, my dad wont fix my car or buy me a new one, and without that I cannot get a job. They are trying to pressure me into a job and college, but I don't know what I wanna do, and i'm not ready to get a job.

So what creeps into my head constantly is why not just die now and get it over with.I used to cut myself but I know if I start again it\\'ll be the end of me. I won\\'t be able to stop.  This sounds so lame, even to me.  I just wish there were some way out.  My worry now is the \"hey, why don\\'t I just end this now\" thoughts are getting worse. There are a bunch of other things I could write but it\\'s just too much to blab all over the place. I\\'m putting this out there because I have to admit it to someone.  Even if there are no responses, I\\'m fine with it.  I just have to say the words to someone other than my kids - who worry about their \"best mom in the whole world who has sacrificed everything for them, including a personal life\" taking a header because all I can see is a loooong road of lonely while I stand by and watch everyone else be happy.It\\'s getting to where I\\'m scared.  Not so much that I\\'ll consciously do anything because of what it would do to my kids - but that I\\'m going to drown in this awful feeling of numb despair until I wind up hospitalized.  The only way I can make myself laugh is by repeating that line from that old _PERSON_ movie On The Waterfront (haven\\'t seen it, just remember the line) \"I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody\"I really could have.

I could be in the sunshine, and just not want to do anything but die. Then I sort of got caught up in some sort of world epiphany. I don't know how to describe it. Maybe this sounds stupid, but everything gradually just sort of...connected. I can't pinpoint when it started, or what caused it, but I had a major shift in how I perceive things. I became amazed with ever little thing, and the art and beauty of the world. Think about the very pillars that make up our incredibly complex life here on earth. Millions of creatures, eating, breathing, living, and dying, killing one another, or living side by side; all of this creates a magnificent symphony of equilibrium and homeostasis. To truly understand the inner workings of these life characteristics and how our world works would take a lifetime. The simple act of an animal going about life is complex, the act of breathing, sleeping, and thinking, with so many hormones and chemicals deciding so many outcomes, all of it working together is amazing, yet that same form of complexity is also present down to each and every single cell, such as bacteria feeding, or plants performing photosynthesis. I am truly amazed every time I think about how amazing it is that the world works so well with so many moving parts, let alone with human beings causing more and more problems every year. Now imagine all of that complexity and expand it outwards as well, for the same form of distinguishing push and pull, this evolution of external forces changing and adapting also extends to the stars, black holes, dying stars, gas clouds, and wayward asteroids form massive changes outside our field of vision, where we are just now beginning to gain sight of. Among all of this, one shudders to imagine what great marvels lay beyond visible galaxies, and our known universe itself. Does it go on forever? Does it end with a quiet fade into the endless abyss? It is in our very nature to ask questions, and our beautiful universe proposes so many.I just wanted to say to everyone out there, you have no idea how many people out there are feeling and thinking the way you are. Maybe it takes companionship, maybe it takes some sort of change in your emotions, I don't know- BUT, and this is important, you can NEVER give up. Something or someone will find you, and you WILL get past it. You have to believe it. I had no hope at all once, and I was ready to kill myself. So please, just hold on. Every single person is special and you deserve to give yourself a chance. I just feel like I had to put this out there for everyone.\", 'label': 'a'}\n",

I still want to, and I am planning to do it.\", 'post_body': \"To be blunt, I find the act of living to be horrible.  In my experience people are not nice to each other, and are most commonly plain abusive. I was sexually assaulted as a child by a woman hired to take care of me. Because I'm a man I've been told that this actually isn't possible because of my gender, and also told to stop using the word rape to describe the experience. I've been told this people who supposedly love me.My first suicide attempt was in grade school and was on campus.  I was using a knife and was working up the courage for a particularly deep cut.  When a teacher caught me I begged not to be sent home.  I was sent home without delay.  When my parents found out what I had done I was sent to my room, and told to do my homework. No one asked why I did it.My next serious attempt was in freshman year of high school. I had transferred schools hoping that that one change would make my life somehow better. It did not. Once again I was trying to exsanguinate myself.  I knew I couldn't do suffocation or choking as I had tried those and my survival instincts were too hard to suppress.  This time I was sent to the school counselor once I was caught, and was then hospitalized.Shortly before freshman year of university I made my next attempt by poisoning. My significant other made abusive comments about my sexuality and I allowed myself to internalize them into a redefinition of my self worth. In addition to poisoning I sat in a car in the garage with the engine on hoping to get carbon monoxide poisoning.  My sister caught me asking what I was doing. I lied saying I had lost something in the car and was trying to find it.  Later my significant other asked what was wrong and I admitted that I had swallowed two entire bottles of pain pills.  Once again I was hospitalized.I later married her.  On one hand she says abusive things, or did at that time. On another hand she saved my life and professed to love me.Over the next ten years we remained married, and between us there has been at least three attempts for one person or another to die.  I've lost count and it all blends together in my head.  Suffice to say things have not gone smoothly, and I know we are not healthy.I have had to promise and vow and swear over and over again to other people to not kill myself.  I feel like I'm held captive my life and I want to escape it. I'm convinced that a change of circumstance such as a different job or a divorce would not change this outlook.  I am convinced that everywhere I go everyone will still be abusive to each other and prop themselves up by belittling each other making each other miserable.I hate life.  All life is is the unending struggle to stay alive and it always ends with death.  So why not skip the struggle and just get to the ending?Edit: I am thinking strongly of using a credit card to rent a storage bin big enough for myself and my car, parking in it, leaving the engine on and the window down, and then taking a boatload of pills. Then I could lie back, fall asleep, and just never wake up.  Then this whole mess called life would finally be over.  Out of fear of living through it though I could just be extra thorough and simultaneously exsanguinate. This is the most difficult part for me so I'd likely resort instead to suffocation or ligature compression, or make the cut after taking a series of blood thinners so that it is less painful and more successful.  My main concern is having someone find my body after rescue is impossible but to still be found.  I guess this is important to me for the sentimental reason that I don't want anyone to think that I just dissapeared or leave them with some belief that I'm alive out there somewhere.\", 'label': 'd'}\n",

I was born near Detroit, my father was a drug dealer and my mom was a drug addict. Most of my memories of my biological parents involve fighting. My biological mom left when I was eight and my stepmom moved in. She had all of the bipolar drug addict craziness of my mom without any of the giving a shit about me that came with the previous model. My whole life I\\'ve had to live as an impostor. I was sent to a different school district than the area I grew up in because my dad knew I would get my ass kicked if I went to the local neighborhood school. I had to lie about what my dad did for work and where I lived, I also had to deal with not being able to join any clubs or participate in events because my family wouldn\\'t pay the fees. I graduated in 2007, right before the economy went to shit.I wasn\\'t able to find a job so I had to help my dad by living in one of his cheap grow houses in a shitty mostly abandoned neighborhood. The only running water went to the basement for the plants so I needed to fill buckets of water and carry them upstairs to have water to cook with, clean with and drink. About 3 years ago I decided I needed to find a craft and start a career. I choose to study Systems Administration at ITT tech. I was able to complete the program and get an associates, but my GPA was only 2.9 and I failed a few classes because I was unable to get rides to school or afford bus fare (the bus system in detroit is also notoriously bad). So I get my degree and my head full of computer knowledge and two years and three helpdesks later I know I don\\'t want to be an IT guy anymore, but now I have no idea what I want to do. I\\'m buried in student loan debt to the tune of 40,000 and my only other plan in life was to be a writer. A few of my teachers told me I had talent but my family just said I needed to be more worried about making money and less on stupid bullshit. While I was working, I met my wife and after about half a year she became pregnant. I moved out of my parents house and in with my inlaws while my wife was pregnant. My daughter is a year old now and she and my wife are able to provide some comfort, but it\\'s only small in the moment stuff. Nothing can help me with my deeper issues. I\\'ve completely lost hope that I will ever turn my life around and get to a place where I\\'m happy. College was supposed to turn my life around and all I did was pay 40 grand to learn that the helpdesk is a soul sucking nightmare. My wife and kid were supposed to turn my life around but the amount of pressure I feel when I think about how hard their lives will be with me. I\\'ve never really found a place where I fit in or a place I could call home. I never felt like I belonged with my family, a timid bookworm among grease monkeys and small time thugs. I was outcast by the outcasts in high school. I never really made friends in college and work is a different monster entirely. Every helpdesk I\\'ve worked on has pushed my stress meter to 11/10. The hectic pace of the work and the constantly reinforced expectations of perfection would have me so stressed out by the end of the day that I would just yell at my family if I talked to them at all. Hell at one of my jobs I literally could not handle the pressure anymore and just walked out on a job I had been at for over a year. I\\'ve been unemployed since May and my family has become increasingly frustrated with me. I feel like my dreams or dead. I can\\'t even write without feeling stupid about it. I thought getting a \"real job\" would be the key to digging myself out of poverty but now all I am is a working sucker. My dad may be broke now but when he was my age he would walk around with over five grand in his wallet, cash. Not only have I not surpassed my father by going straight, I\\'ve pretty much proved how pointless it actually is. I can\\'t wait for this magical point where all of my hard work will finally turn into something that makes me happy anymore. When I look at my future all I see is more disappointment and heartache. Even if I worked full time and in my field I would not be able to take care of my family. All I can see is a future of living in bad areas, struggling to keep the lights on, and explaining to my daughter why she can\\'t afford to go to X or do _PERSON_ I\\'m never going to be successful enough to publish a book or explore any part of the world that isn\\'t the one I was born in. I can\\'t hold a job for more than a year without having some kind of nervous breakdown. I live with my wife and my own flesh and blood daughter and I still feel like I don\\'t belong here. I feel like I\\'m never going to find anywhere I belong or can be happy. I\\'m going to be one of the sad bluecollar people who busts their ass at a job they hate until they are just too dead and empty inside to do anything else. The more I look over the landscape of my future the more I don\\'t want it. I can\\'t endure that life and I don\\'t want to. I don\\'t want to improve myself because I still have to build all of that improvement on a broken pile of shit. I wish I could be someone else. I wish I could be one of those six-figure white kids who went to a real university and goes on vacation every year. I wish I would\\'ve had a family that would\\'ve supported my writing, but it\\'s too late now. It\\'s too late to do anything. Someday when I grow up is now here and I have chosen poorly and will spend the rest of my life suffering for it.I love my wife and my daughter, but I just want to be dead so bad it hurts. I\\'ve even hoped that my wife would throw me out of the house or take her and leave just so I could feel less bad about leaving them alone. I\\'ve thought about using one of my father-in-law\\'s guns to blow my own brains out or walking around in public with a knife so that the cops would have to kill me. There used be times when I was driving home from work and I would fantasize about getting in an accident so that I wouldn\\'t have to deal with the struggle anymore. I\\'m just so sick of struggling. I\\'m so tired of being held back by the same bullshit and always feeling like I\\'m doing something wrong, saying something wrong, or that there is something wrong with me. My family knows about my mental health. They say they want to help, but nothing ever comes of it. So far the closest I\\'ve gotten is a treatment center that requires medicaid who cut my services off after I was denied. Now I\\'m back to square one. Someday soon I\\'m going to snap and do something irrational. Everyday I just try to hold it together and distract myself with video games or reading but the thoughts of my disappointing life so far and the disappointment in the future are always there ready to drag me down. Maybe it won\\'t be tomorrow, maybe it won\\'t be till my daughter is 5 or 6 but I feel like a ticking time bomb. I\\'m just so lost and scared. I was dealt a shitty hand and I played it wrong and now I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do with myself let alone the wife and daughter who depend on me. It\\'s too much.', 'label': 'c'}\n",

I step off the stool and my body starts to stuggle, my brain is fighting to stay alive. After a little bit and realizing the rope will hold I manage to step back on the stool.

I used to see a doctor and take medicine (both cost me about $600/month when I could afford it), but my income has been slowly falling ... now it is $505/month working as an adjunct professor at a community college. I have no wife, girlfriend or kids; indeed, I\\'m still a virgin at 44, years ago having given up on any hope of finding someone who would be willing to put up with me. Family is far away, but they never call me--I\\'m always the one who has to initiate contact. My sister never seems that interested in talking to me, and I literally have to beg to speak with my nieces. Attempts to find more work have all led to disappointment and failure. Because I\\'m a single male with no kids and a job that is reported to the state as only 4 hours a week, I don\\'t qualify for any kind of assistance whatsoever in the state of Florida. I currently sleep in the building where I used to teach piano lessons. Craigslist ads for getting students has yielded absolutely zero new students, but several attempts to scam me. I used to have 75 students. I\\'m down to 4 students now, and closing the studio down is a real possibility that would just emphasize how much I have failed, plus giving me no place but the outside to deal with.I tried a Kickstarter for a children\\'s book which failed: less than 20 people even bothered to back it and I only got 1/2 of the amount I asked for. (Reddit thought it was a horrible book, and I guess they were right, given that they predicted the Kickstarter would fail after the first week.) I illegally sleep in my piano teaching studio now, as I have for several years now, trying to put my life back together. But everything I do seems to just keep me where I am without any improvement. I answered an ad for an online piano teaching job, but my internet connection and computer aren\\'t fast and powerful enough. I\\'d need over $500 in equipment to get started with no guarantee of students.I spent this month\\'s rent money on a limo driver\\'s certification hoping to find some work there ... All of the places here want not only the certification I got, but another certification in the neighboring county, and they want me to purchase my own GPS unit with a minimum of 2 chargers (smartphone doesn\\'t count), which costs more money which I don\\'t have, so I feel like I wasted that money getting the certificate.I owe $20,000 in back taxes to the IRS. They\\'ve refused offers in compromise twice already. The tax lien placed on my name prevents me from getting any sort of credit, and has prevented me from qualifying for a lease for a small studio apartment (probably a good thing, because I would have ultimately been unable to pay the rent and been evicted).The temp agency I applied at has not called me once for any positions, and calls to the agency are met with a stern \"we will call you if we are able to match you with something\\' please stop calling us.\"I\\'ve gone from eating rice and beans to just rice, when I can force it down.  I have most of the materials needed to end my life.I have fantasies of attempting suicide and then getting the help I need because of the attempt. Then I feel horrible because I shouldn\\'t be abusing anything that way or be that manipulative. So I can\\'t just attempt to end my life ... I have to make sure it succeeds so that no one can accuse me of \"just wanting attention\" or being a lazy burden on everyone, or being accused of selfishly wanting to hurt everyone.It would be weeks before anyone would know if I were able to carry it out tonight. Students would just think I was sick or on vacation. The college would fire me after I missed class twice in a row without letting them know--but they\\'d do it through email, not by calling or any other method. Family would just think that I was busy and they\\'d leave voicemail messages if they called at all.All I have now is venting to places like _PERSON_ and here, and I know it\\'s not enough. But this is all I have. It\\'s all I can afford to do. If I were a more worthy person, I\\'d be able to afford \"real\" treatment which I\\'ve since learned is only a mask covering the reality. But if one is poor, one doesn\\'t even deserve the mask. Life and society would objectively be better off without me.That last sentence was really egotistical of me: 99.9999996% of the world won\\'t even know or care that I\\'m gone. Their lives are not made better and only negligibly made worse by me existing.I don\\'t even know now why I wrote all of this. Maybe it\\'s hoping that someone cares or even at least pretends to care for a few moments. Or maybe it was just me making things more definite and concrete. I\\'m not even sure if it matters anymore. I\\'m just overwhelmed and have nowhere to turn, and maybe I don\\'t deserve to be able to turn anywhere. This is the third time in 24 hours I\\'ve written something like this ... I deleted the other two without posting ... I fell asleep crying while typing this last night. I can\\'t keep living like this, but every attempt to make a difference has ultimately failed or backfired. I\\'m scared to do or try anything else. All anyone can do to help me is talk, and the time for talking\\'s over. It just prolongs the inevitable.EDIT: I\\'m still here, mainly because I barely have the willpower to get up, let alone do something meaningful. I lay on a Walmart army-style cot alternating between typing and crying and sleeping and waking up from some Old Time Radio Dragnet episodes I have on another computer and which I just haven\\'t gotten around to turning off. I was told to remove some sentences where I talked about how I would end my life. I finally got around to doing that, and I\\'m sorry for all the disruption I\\'ve caused.

I try to come off as funny or interesting, but Im a boring piece of shit with no interests or passions that I could ever live up to or dedicate myself to long enough to even come close to getting better at them. Im not smart, Im not attractive, Im not sociable, Im not athletic, Im nothing. I just try to make jokes and create interesting stories, but even those suck. I used to be smart, or atleast feel like it. I cant construct normal thoughts, and my vocabulary is limited. Im not talented like any of the kids I see at school. I have no specialty, no hobbies. Im just a mess who tries to catch up but never will. Im an edgy idiot with a small brain, and Ik its true. I spend hours studying things people grasp in minutes, then get distracted for a few hours more.. I think I have potential somewhere, but I dont actually. Not even an adhd pill helped me focus because Im so fucking stupid. I cant form normal thoughts, Im always sidetracked. I think that maybe I have some potential, or Im a smart person, just that I cant express it or I cant focus and tap into that intelligence. But that will never happen, because nothing has helped me do so. I cant be a fucking artist or a writer because even my handwritings too shit to express thoughts on paper, let alone draw. Im going to be zoning out and thinking of philosophies and concepts of life for the rest of mine, but I\\'ll never be able to hold a normal conversation with anyone for too long because I dont know how to express myself or how to utilize my thoughts or thinking abilities. I try and make myself feel better by acting like I have an idea of whats going on and I have some redeeming qualities, or that Im someone whos different in a good way, instead of a fucking ball of anxiety, distraction, insecurity, and endless self-construed facades aimed at myself and others alike. I think I have a mental disorder, or that theres something wrong with me. Theres nothing wrong with me, theres no excuse for my stupidity, my laziness, and inability to grasp simple concepts. I act like I like the people around me, like I understand them and like they understand me. Everytime someone finally gets close to me, my relationship with them is bound to end in a shitty way because I cant help but act out because Im too irresponsable to keep a long term relationship. I think Im something different, or someone who matters. Im slow as hell and cant construct simple thoughts and do simple things, or pick up on social cues and not be a rude fuck. I think that maybe, Im a nice person, or maybe _PERSON_ finally find whatever Im good at or finally settle down with someone who likes me or finally meet someone who seems like me. But I cant express anything. Im just a stupid piece of shit who wishes he had some value or some importance. I piss off anyone I get too close to, or I burden the people Im close to because Im an over flowing shit hole of problems that needs to dump itself on other people to feel fine. I try to think that others like me, or can actually manage to enjoy my obnoxious company. I think that I have a future in writing films or making music, but Im never going to live up to any of the expectations I set for myself. Im just going to keep failing, over and over again. Or I could settle for less, and live my entire life wishing to be living on the greener grass. And after I write this memo, Im gonna go back to that life of bullshit where I act like Im not a complete retard, or like I can think and function normally and talk to people normally. I think I might stop snapping out in anger, or Im not an edgy fuck. I think I might even be nice, but in reality Im just a selfish prick who only cares for himself and cant try to grasp the concept that the world doesnt revolve around him. I think that Im the main character in my movie, but in reality _PERSON_ probably just stay a cameo or the villain everyone wants to see die. I do stupid things and I think loathful thoughts when I get angry out of the blue, and afterwards the only things I can do are wonder what the fuck is wrong with me and that I wish someone understood me, and knew that I hadnt snapped out because Im an evil person, just that I snapped out because Im a fucking idiot who has no self control or will power. Then _PERSON_ go back to my normal life. Im gonna keep saying \"Im fine\" everyday. And I will be fine. Because Im only introspective enough to see how useless I am once every few days. _PERSON_ cry my heart out, ask for support, then wipe my tears and put my mask back on. Then _PERSON_ repeat the cycle, and eventually whoever I cry to will get sick of me, and eventually _PERSON_ run out of people to cry to. Im a fucking trap of negativity that draws everyone around me into it, and theres nothing more to it. And I have so many god damn masks that fit so well on me. I can be any personality or mood I want to be, and I can do it so perfectly that I feel that mood. I emulate acts in my brain, programs where I say to myself to start acting one way or another to acclimate to my setting and my surroundings. and I feel happy for a bit, but Ik that the happiness is just an illusion and a facade, because when that happiness leaves, the anxiety, depression, and my racing mind all come back. And thats the only thing Im good at--faking myself out. And at that point, I dont even know who or what my real self is. I just have a bunch of personalities. I think that my real self would be the ambitious one, that thinks he can go to a good college and be a smart, balanced, healthy kid. That somewhere along the timeline or template of actions Im in, something will change and _PERSON_ finally be able to relate to and socialize on the same level with more than just two people. That maybe _PERSON_ stop being able to analyze every detail around me and stop knowing what details and things are inevitable, and _PERSON_ stop running processes in my head like a fucking computer to talk to people or guess their thoughts and feelings. That maybe, _PERSON_ finally be able to stop the racing thoughts and channel my intelligence onto something more current. _PERSON_ finally be able to be good enough for the good people around me who watch out for me and care for me regardless of the dead weight I am. _PERSON_ finally amount to more than just an undiagnosed piece of shit that was the result of a condom rupture.

But finding suicide tragically beautiful and researching suicide methods, even out of curiosity, is so dangerous, and I am agonizingly afraid that one day I might tip over and start planning my own death.&amp;nbsp;For the record, I didn't find a method that I liked. All the means of suicide I found were either not symbolic enough for my situation or too slow or painful for me to be satisfied with. And I hope that I never find something I like because if I end up giving up on life, I'll be so much closer to death if I know how I want to go.&amp;nbsp;As a side note, I should've probably used a throwaway to post this. But a big part of me is hoping someone will stumble upon this thread and a few of the past ten of my threads while going through my profile and let other people know because I have no guts to tell anyone directly.\", 'label': 'c'}\n",

For better or worse about halfway through my unconscious overpowered me and I stopped the process.  There have also been way too many attempts of me trying to fix myself with exercise, self-help stuff, meditation, blah blah blah.My question for anyone who goes through this: is this a continual urge for you or does it come and go?  I ask because I recently told a friend about this and the friend said that it is usually a constant thing.  For me I never want to live and given the choice I would normally take a \"death while I sleep\" almost any day of the week.  But, the actual urge to actively kill myself is not constant.

I have read well over 30 books from actual psychology/therapist books (finished a good one few weeks ago about \"Behavioral Activation\") about how to treat patients to self-help books and philosophy books about happiness such as Stoicism.  I exercise daily (last week Wednesday I walked 10 miles, today at least 5).  I do not drink (zero alcohol in over 60 days).  I do not do drugs other than caffeine once in awhile or something for headaches.  I have not masturbated in over 60 days (something I read said some people get addicted to porn-masturbation-orgasm and this leads to problems with dopamine to over-simplify).  I have done lots of physical and social things such as martial arts (2 years), swing dance (2.5 years), chess tournaments, running 6 miles, hanging out with friends, dating websites...I spent the past 10 years wanting to not be alive.  While I was seeing therapists I tried to kill myself.  I said \"therapists\" because the first was not helping despite me telling him that I was going to kill myself **and how I was going to kill myself**.  The second I was preparing (buying stuff and practicing) and the second also did not take me seriously again despite me stating exactly what I was going to do.  I have seen other therapists besides those 2, none of them take me seriously.  The attempt was approximately 2 years ago.So, I decided since nobody else gives a rats ass about me despite paying them thousands of dollars that I might as well keep my thousands of dollars...  I thought maybe the problem was my work made me hate my life.  I knew that I started thinking about killing myself while still in high school, but maybe the attempt was due to the job just made everything worse.  I was an electrical engineer working on a $1 billion project which literally would not have gotten done on schedule and would have had many more problems had I not been on it.  Last I heard that project has generated well over $9 billion in revenue and the client my company was doing work for (which has only ever complained about everyone else) had mentioned me by name multiple times as doing a great job.  I did try to get a job as an electrical engineer for the past 1 year, I was told repeatedly from potential employers and recruiters that nobody is going to hire me to do anything other than what I was doing which is out of the question.But, I figured that since I did try to kill myself that I had to get out.  I am about to start a programming bootcamp.  I have done programming, I liked programming, nobody is going to hire me right now to do programming.  This particular training has a 94% employment rate with a higher average starting salary than I was making at the job I hated.So now, here I am about to begin a career change by learning programming from professionals.  I can only think about how I want to die and seriously am considering trying again...Is the thought process from the anxiety of the programming training?  In part, yes.  Last week (the week I walked 10 miles on Wednesday) on both Thursday and Friday I walked at least 6 miles each and other than that I spent the day in bed unable to move from depression.I can afford the bootcamp, living expenses (apartment, food, etc), and I have a few extra months of expenses saved up in case I do not get a job right after the training ends.  I *cannot* afford to waste more money on a bunch of (insert text) therapists who ignore the fact that I am literally in the process of killing myself and provide no support.So what the fuck am I supposed to do now that I want to die, I have wanted to die for more than a third of my life, nobody I pay takes me seriously and I cannot afford to pay them right now anyway, and I really need to be able to actually think because I am going to spend the next 3 months learning a new career and being depressed is not a good thing to be while learning a new career path and networking and going on interviews!?', 'label': 'c'}\n",

Where the merry-go-round ends no one knows.', 'post_body': \"I've been suffering depression since I was in 5th grade (Elementary, 9/10 years old). The first time I told my parents I wanted to kill myself was in 5th grade. They casually laughed and brushed it off saying you're too young to know what that entails. Going through Middle school (Junior High, 12‚Äî14 years) I got worse. I was able to function and achieved high grades as well as excellent remarks from my teachers, but it wasn't enough. There was always the constant thought of what if I just killed myself. Back then I was being threatened by this man that he would kill my family members in the most gruesome ways possible. The police became involved after I sent an email of panick to some government website saying I was suicidal and whatnot. That day, my parents finally took my depression and suicidality seriously. A few weeks later, I was ordered by the police to join therapy; my parents complied. Entering High School (14‚Äî17 years) things got even *worse*. I got my first boyfriend during my freshman year except he was a senior. I didn't know it at the time, but everyone thought I was a slut for that. I became labeled as a gold-digger, easy, slut, whore, etc. Solely because I dated a senior during my freshman do year in high. I found all of this out later in my Sophmore year when the whispers wouldn't stop, the snickers would be shot my way with menacing glares, and the isolation began. I was no longer with my senior boyfriend, but as high school works, once you're labeled, you might as well brand it on your forehead. I moved onto my second boyfriend, A, whom later raped me at my own home. I was strangled and often verbally abused by him. After I broke up with him, he continued to spread rumors about me at school, often exploiting that we had sex and I am his main prostitute. I soon began to go to school everyday carrying a scissor in my backpack. In almost every class, I'd cut myself as I cried silently. None of this made me feel better. Eventually, I went to my counselors and asked to check myself into a mental ward. This experience just worsened me. Finally, I decided to leave that high school and become home-schooled basically. I only go to an affiliated high school once a week for one hour. I no longer want to cut myself and for the past four or five months I have been as stable as I can be. However, lately I've been feeling extremely down due to family members and an issue that arised  here on reddit, which I won't discuss. I'm at the point where I don't really eat, drink, and sleep too much. Life brings me no joy and I feel as if I can never become truly happy. Now I have an itch on my wrist that seems to scream encouragements for a blade. My parents have grounded me for 6 months which doesn't end till August. During that time period, I'm not allowed to see my friends (I only have 2), which isn't a big deal, *BUT* as it is, I don't go to school anymore. The school I go to once a week make sure you never see any other kids and I'm stuck at home or at my aunts house all day except for that one hour Monday‚ÄîSunday. I feel isolated, alone, lonely, and frustrated because I can't get away from my family, my depression, and my past. _PERSON_: I'm taking _PERSON_ (antidepressant) and have been professionally diagnosed with Major Chronic Depressive Disorder.

Hope this is the right place. It's about 3:30 here, given up on waking at 7:00 this morning to go to the clinic. So, going to write here. I grew up in Arizona. Wasn't born there, I was born in Montreal, QC, Canada, (where I am now), but, I lived over 12 years there. My stepfather was abusive, only to me, because my mother had told him at the start that if he hit her, she would divorce him, and because my sister was too pure, I suppose. I have a few memories that pop up from time to time, lots of stuff from my sister, though, as the experience made me repress most of my childhood...I do not remember anything before I was 13 in any coherency, I do not know any of my old teachers, for example. Anyways, not really the point, as what's going wrong started around the time that I can remember, when I was 13. I had been trying to get a 'girlfriend' for a long time, probably to be cool or such, who knows. I had talked with girls a bit, most didn't like me too much. I was passingly curious about homosexual activities, but my thoughts were on girls. I found out that there was a guy who was gay (gasp) at my school, and I eventually talked to him. I asked him about all sorts of stuff, curiosity coming out, and, well, I mentioned my parents weren't home, and that was my first sexual experience. I later found out that he was essentially the ringleader of the gays in my school, being the only non-closeted. I had a few more encounters with him, few because he was not attracted to me, and would insult me before, during and after the experience, which wasn't fun. He 'set me up' with some of the other closeted guys...4 in total, I think, and I had experiences with them as well. That's how I started being the school slut. Fast forward three years, and I had been fucked by 10 other guys, I'd never top for various reasons. I had some relationships during that time, but not very strong ones, as I was a slut first and foremost. Recently (January 2012), I eventually fell in love with someone I had known for over a year. And another person I had known for the same time, at the same time. They did not know each other, I loved them both, and did not know which to pursue. I tried for both. About July 2012, I let it break that I loved them both, had them talk ,and, after tears and fighting, we entered a sort of three-way relationship. By this point, I was aware that my past might hurt them, so I told them that I 'hated anal', so I wouldn't endanger them too much. They brought my total to 12. More recently (3 weeks ago), one eventually had me make a choice between them, I chose one over the other, tried to help the one who was not chosen, talking to him lots, ect, ect. I've remained on pretty good terms with him, he wants to re-enter, obviously that's a problem and all, but, lots of stress for everyone around. Also, recently (January 2013) moved back to Montreal to live with my father and go to University here (Concordia). I got my health card about a week ago, and booked an appointment with my school's clinic (free healthcare and whatnot). Told them what I needed, did the urine test, was supposed to do the blood test tomorrow, but, as stated, can't sleep, so, will probably do it Saturday. That's the one I'm afraid of. Because there is a damn high chance I have HIV in me and don't know it yet. Especially because of my first encounter, as that guy had fucked every closeted gay in school. Which was dozens. I'll be getting the results on the 13th, I believe. I take the subway home...but I promised the one I did not choose that I would not do anything the day I find out, to at least talk to them beforehand, and give closure...he says it's to convince me otherwise, but...anyways. If that test comes back positive, I know I will be emotionally wrecked...well, more than that, my life is gone. There's no telling when it'd develop to AIDS and kill me painfully...I'd likely drop out of school. Just... *sigh* Hello.

I\\'ve been jaded for many years but have come to the conclusion that I want to end my life.&gt;-Hi to anyone who stops by and hears my _PERSON_ sorry for the _PERSON_ don\\'t remember the first time I thought of killing myself, but I do remember that my earliest thoughts never involved doing it any time soon. I\\'ve always had the commitment that I wouldn\\'t want to live much pass 50, I\\'m currently 18, and in most circumstances thinking about my own death I knew unless of an accident prior, I would want to put myself out. This has always been the way I thought of my own death since I lost my cousin (who was 17 at the time) to a car accident in late 2008; the first time I really thought about my own mortality. I\\'ve been on a steady decline, depression wise, since then. Although I don\\'t really believe that the accident was what triggered it.I\\'m now seeing my classmates send off to university as I\\'m stuck at home without my high school diploma because I\\'ve failed 3 classes in the last year. My parents couldn\\'t be more disappointed, and their disappointment is really the only reason why I\\'m going back to school for the 3 credits. You see, my parents also play a key role in why at first I didn\\'t want to kill myself. I\\'ve always been told suicide is a selfish act, it\\'s what you hear on the news and in classrooms, that individuals that kill themselves are only thinking about themselves. That is why I always figured, maybe I\\'ll wait for my parents to go before I do. But now I\\'m thinking maybe not.I\\'ve kept the same job for a couple years now, starting as a busboy in October of 2013 at a local pub/restaurant. I\\'ve met some really great people there, who have helped boost my confidence socially and personally. I feel more relaxed at work then at school and I think I act more myself around my co-workers than my friends. Not to say I don\\'t relate to my friends but I\\'m really not as close with my pals as I used to be. I\\'ve started forcing jokes that fall flat and although have recently put extra effort into finding time to be with them, the time spent is awkward and unpleasant. I still want all my friends to be a part of my life, but I haven\\'t felt connected to the clique in a long time.I found this subreddit following my discovery of the deadredditors sub reddit. The first thought popping into my mind being maybe I\\'d be on there soon. That\\'s when it kind of clicked. I\\'m suicidal. I have been for years. Sure I\\'m also depressed, of which I\\'ve been medically proven to be, but what I\\'ve been feeling since the earliest thoughts of my own mortality is the apathy of life. The indifference for destiny. And a whole lot of self hatred.I used to self harm; when I was maybe 14 or 15. Only one friend knew about it, my closest friend at the time, who also self-harmed. I wouldn\\'t consider myself emo, I got over that phase a long time ago. I think I just kind of did it to assure myself of my loathing, but there was really no question about it, that I hated myself, which is why I stopped. I\\'ve since lost this friend (somewhat). He currently in an abusive relationship with a girl that tried to claim I sexually assaulted her, which I didn\\'t. He\\'s now just looking for an answer to breaking up with her, but knows if he does it for the plain sake of not liking her as a human being, she will threaten to kill herself. It\\'s twisted because he\\'s knows what it feels like to have someone in his life try to kill themselves because I remember him telling me one time about how he had just received a text from a friend who was in the hospital after attempting suicide.At this point it now sounds like I live in some town full of kids trying to kill themselves which isn\\'t really true. In fact of the thousands of kids who live in this town these are really the only major cases I know of.Right now as I\\'m almost breaking 4000 characters, I realize what I\\'m saying isn\\'t even really the thick of it. Re-reading the text didn\\'t feel the same as typing it, which is weird. Re-reading it felt a lot more disconnected emotionally. I\\'m not sure why I am mentioning this, but I\\'ll now continue.So, why do I now feel like how early I go won\\'t change a thing? Well mathematically doing it earlier will give more time for anyone who cares to heal. But also I realized rethinking my cousin\\'s death that humans are a lot more prone to accepting tragedies than we really think. It was devastating, waking up at 3 AM to my mother on the phone crying then sitting on my bed clutching her arms around me as she shared what had happened. But to the same effect if I were to go now or ten years from now everything I did in my time here, my consciousness, and my future would be wiped away just the same. So the reason why I am even waiting I can\\'t figure out. I\\'ve already mentioned that I have to go back to school although I hate it and that my close friendships seem to be unrecoverable. My entire life I\\'ve consistently embarrassed and resented myself. I don\\'t think I\\'m looking for an answer for not killing myself. I just can\\'t think of why I shouldn\\'t.At this time the answer \"It does get better\" feels really pathetic, I have no desire to go to any kind of post-secondary education even after I get my diploma and I\\'ll just end up being a deadbeat until I die anyways.', 'label': 'c'}\n",

Started in high school, around sophomore year, I think. I don't know why it started. I used to be this incredibly smart kid. I was way beyond my peers in first grade in almost every academic sense, and I was way more mature than kids my age. My parents were good to me, I loved my two little sisters and older brother, and things were fine. Then one day I just wasn't able to summon the motivation to do things anymore. I developed a flippant attitude towards my future, and my grades plummeted. My mom looked through my phone one day and saw I was sending suicidal text messages to my now ex-boyfriend, so she freaked and immediately sent me to a therapist. The therapist helped some. Eventually I dropped out of high school, got my GED, and immediately moved two hours away to study programming at a college there. I never finished. I couldn't learn. It's like I had a wall in my mind that prevented me from learning anything. This was extremely discouraging, since I desperately wanted to learn but couldn't summon the motivation to do much. I turned in assignments late or not at all. Eventually I stopped going to classes altogether. Each semester I'd steel myself, tell myself I would do better this time. I'd successfully go to class every day for a few weeks, stay on top of my homework, then I'd start to slip again. I tried to use the school's counseling and grief center, but was told I'd have to wait at least three months to see someone, so I didn't bother. It felt pointless. At this point I was living on my own and working a full time job, going to only a few classes each semester. Eventually I gave up on college altogether and dropped out. I would spend days curled up in my basement apartment in bed, crying and sleeping and sitting around the house, staring at the wall and feeling hopeless and alone. Fast forward three years. I moved to another state (because Montana is a terrible place for the artistically or technologically inclined). I've come close to attempting suicide three different times at the beginning of this year. I work full time and still live alone. I have enough money to pay my bills, but no extra money to set aside. I haven't bought actual groceries for myself since I moved here. I just get a few small things here and there or eat the samples at the wholesale warehouse I work at. I was in a relationship with a wonderful guy for a year after I moved here, and he proposed to me, and I said yes. I ended up ending things after doing some hard thinking and realizing that certain issues we had weren't going to magically be resolved by marrying each other. This is what set off the latest bout of suicidal thoughts. I know leaving him was the best thing to do for myself, but it's been so hard. I've wanted to get help for a long time, but I just can't afford it. My bank account is usually empty. The state won't allow me to have health care, welfare, or food stamps because I have no children. I won't be able to get health insurance from my job until next July.This has been affecting my second job severely. I've always been an artist, ever since I was a child. I draw characters and design book covers for people online. I used to love drawing and I used to do it every single day. Now I dread it and can't seem to dredge up the motivation or the ideas to do it very much anymore. I still have a list of people that are waiting on me to finish what they paid for. I need to do more commissions, so I can have that extra money I need, but it's been essentially impossible lately. The only thing that has seemed to help recently is getting stoned on the weekends. When I get stoned, I draw like crazy. I can't stop. I want to draw all the ideas that come flooding out of my head, and I want to finish them all. I have motivation, I have creativity, and I can forget all the things that bother me. I want to be an animator or character design artist for Disney or Pixar one day.I feel like there is no one I can reach out to about this. I'm scared to tell my family members, because I'm worried that they'll freak out and call the cops or something. I only have one friend, who lives back in Montana. She's my best friend and art buddy and I miss her every single day. I miss drawing with her all the time. We talk on the phone frequently, but I've never told her that I'm suicidal. I don't want to scare her or freak her out. I've never been good at socializing or making friends, and lately, I just want to be alone and not talk to anyone. The only thing that's really kept me from killing myself yet is my two cats. I've had them since they were both two weeks old, and I adore them. I can't imagine what would happen to them if I was gone. There have been plenty of times where I gave up food for myself so they could eat instead. My uncle committed suicide when I was 6 or so, and I remember coming into the kitchen and my dad was leaning on the counter, bawling his eyes out. My dad is normally very stoic and quiet, and I don't want to imagine him breaking down again like that when he gets the news that I'm dead.Yet, none of this makes me change my mind or feel better. I've been on reddit for quite a while today, browsing the threads about parents who have found their children that committed suicide, or people who have been wanting to commit suicide, and still I can't shake this. I want to get help so badly, but I can't afford it and I don't know what to do. Talking about it will help for a few weeks, maybe a couple of months, and I'll feel great and be happy, but then the suicidal thoughts always come back. Always. I hate being so miserable like this. I want to be happy, but I don't know what to do. I wonder if I need medication, that maybe something is really really wrong with me. I wonder how I'll pay for medication if I end up needing it. My family was always poor, poor enough that if you got a cut that needed stitches, you put super glue and a band aid on that shit. I haven't gone to a doctor in years. I was always able to tell myself that I didn't NEED it, that I could deal with whatever was ailing me on my own, and that I didn't have enough money anyway.I think about suicide so often that it's become a habit, and I think about it even when I'm perfectly happy and everything is going fine. I've been obsessing over it a lot lately. I hide in the bathroom at work and cry silently and think about swallowing all the pills in my bathroom, or driving my car off the side of the freeway cliffs, or jumping in front of a bus. I don't want to be like this, but I feel like suicide is the only way I can end all this. Life feels so pointless. I feel like I'll always be poor and struggling with money and my art and my future.TL;DR I've been suicidal for four years and want to get help but can't afford it. Suicidal thoughts are becoming more frequent and intense.Sorry if this didn't make sense or if I rambled too much. I'm crying my eyes out and I'm not really thinking too clearly at the moment.\", 'label': 'c'}\n",

Thanks.', 'post_body': 'It seems the longer I live the more sad life becomes. I was diagnosed with PTSD and Major Depression a couple of years ago, stemming from a very rough childhood, along with more incidents in my earlier adult years. I also have no family to speak of, everyone that I thought cared about me turned out to be drug addicts who never had my best intentions in the first place. I have gotten help from a therapist and psychiatrist lately, but it doesn\\'t seem to be helping anything. I\\'m too old to qualify for a lot of things...I don\\'t have healthcare, work a dead-end job at Wal-Mart and my only friend struggles with mental illness, leaving me feel like I\\'m burdening said friend when I reach out for help.I moved here to _PERSON_, FL a couple years back after a stint of trying to care for my brothers in Louisiana. We had all been in foster homes, I lucked out and was able to become independent quite early. My brothers, however, went through various mental institutions and were subjected to massive amount of abuse. Meanwhile, our _PERSON_ was up in Colorado somewhere doing her thing - doing meth and telling me that everything that happened to the family was \"my fault\". I haven\\'t talked to her for about a decade since then. So, I was living in Louisiana with my own apartment and a stable job and decided that my brothers should not end up being screwed over by the foster care system. Keep in mind they both have significant mental illnesses, but I had also not physically seen nor talked to them for many years (they kept us 100% isolated from each other during foster care). I figured I was strong and stable enough to try to fix the situation, and invited them over to live with me. After numerous talks with them on the phone and the case counselors, I paid for their bus tickets, and they came in the summer of \\'09.At first, things went well. We did a lot of crying and hugging and talking about everything that had happened to us over the years. I also had to convince them that what happened was not my fault in any way. Our mother had convinced them that the family was torn apart by me somehow (probably from the night I called the police when she was jacked on meth and pointing a loaded shotgun at us. I was 14 at the time.) Slowly, over time, their trauma started to surface and signs started to slowly show. _PERSON_ towards me. Passive aggressive behavior. Waking up in the middle of the night to find one of them standing over me with a knife. I got them professional help, but it wasn\\'t enough. The situation devolved into them becoming totally unmanageable...I had one working with me at the local factory but he lost his job due to refusing to go to work and told me that I was going to have to support him. My love for my brothers won out, I kept supporting them for another 6 months. Things just kept getting worse and worse...my neighbors started telling me I should watch my back because they were telling them they wanted to kill me. Everything came to a head, I came home from work one day to find out one brother had beaten another with a pipe and gone to jail. After he got out, I told them that I was too emotionally wracked and spent to support them any more. They resorted to blaming me for everything that had happened to them and decided they should move back in with their mother. I could not, as hard as I tried, convince them that it was the worst idea in the world. They had made up their minds though, and I spent the last of my money on their greyhound tickets to the mother in Colorado.I was completely devastated at this point, emotionally and financially. I quit my job because I was having problems going to work on time and not falling apart constantly. A friend of mine offered to take me to Florida and help him set up a business fixing cars. I figured I needed to learn a skill of some kind (I ultimate figured myself to be a techie).I went, and long story short, he ended up closing the shop and being a complete asshole to me. I was homeless for a few weeks until I found work at a local factory that made textiles. After a few months everything seemed to be doing OK. Then, the shift I was on was laid off and I was homeless again. I wasn\\'t meeting people or making friends at this point, I didn\\'t trust anyone and was suffering from mentall illness I didn\\'t even realize I had. I found a job working at McDonalds right before I was about to get kicked out of my trailer. _PERSON_ there as a crew member for a few months, got promoted to a shift manager. Felt like I was doing OK, but then it started going bad again. The store manager used and abused me by working me long hours and generally being a huge ass. I found out he was an ex-felon and had a history of abusing employees, but as it was a franchise and Florida is an at-will employment state, there wasn\\'t much I could do about it. The owners of the business knew this all too well. I bided my time until I found a cheap apartment in _PERSON_ where there was a local community college. Moved there, and started working at a distribution center for Family Dollar. It was around the time I started working at McDonald\\'s that I decided to get professional help for my mental problems. McDonald\\'s was extremely stressful and wasn\\'t helping in that department. Anyways, I worked at Family Dollar for awhile, trying to save up money. Unfortunately, I had a horrible episode of depression that lasted for a couple weeks. It culminated in me not being able to wake up for work anymore, I was literally sleeping about 18-20 hours a day. Called a friend I had made while working for McDonald\\'s telling her I was coming very close to committing suicide. She took me to a CSU (crisis intervention unit) in Panama City. I thought it was a good idea, but it turned out to be a very bad one. I was basically locked into this tiny prison for 3 days, with barely a soul talking to me besides the mentally ill patients already there. Finally talked to the Psychiatrist but he didn\\'t seem to care and upped my dose of Zoloft to 200mg a day. They released me, and I went back home. Was able to start working again, however I was still having extreme problems with sleeping and depression. Received a huge bill in the mail from the CSU ($3000+) and decided going back there was not an option. My counselor told me I should get a physical check up, I did and found out I had _PERSON_\\'s disease. It\\'s an autoimmune disorder that destroys your thyroid over time and causes symptoms like lack of energy, depression and other things. Was prescribed thyroid replacement pills and received yet another large medical bill. I need to mention that at this point I had already started going to my community college, but dropped out due to my mental and personal issues.Fast forward to the present, I\\'m got hired at Wal-Mart in July and decided to give school another shot. I was betting on my hypothyroidism and depression being held in check enough to move forward with my life. However, I found out I owed $850 from _PERSON_ after dropping out. The college stopped accepting student loans altogether this year. The explanation is here: _URL_ I even tried applying for personal loans from various banks, I was denied each time for not having enough of a credit history, and lack of collateral (I only have an older car worth about $2k).I\\'m now considering suicide more than ever. The only thing holding me back before was worry that I would hurt friends and family of mine. Now, however, it seems I am truly and utterly alone in this world. My family has abandoned me, I fucked up my chance at school, I work an extremely low paying job at Wal-Mart. What is really fucked up about all this is that I believe I truly have potential. No ego-trip here, but I know I\\'m fairly smart. I build computers as a hobby and want to make computer science my passion. Of course, this doesn\\'t mean anything in the real world, hard work does. I can\\'t even seem succeed in seemingly simple situations though.I\\'m sorry if this whole rant came through garbled/intelligible. There were MANY MANY details I left out but it would be a literal 500+ page novel to write it all out. No tl;dr here...I just can\\'t come up with one that expresses my feelings well enough. This is the first time I\\'ve told any of this to someone that I didn\\'t trust explicitly. Hopefully someone that uses reddit has been through something similar and has some useful advice. Telling me to call a suicide hotline isn\\'t going to help, tried that already and the disembodied voice that doesn\\'t know me just makes it worse. I\\'m going to find an out either way. Either a financial way out of this mess or a much more permanent way \"out\". If you read through all this, thank you very much for your time, and good luck to anyone else out there suffering with mental illness and/or lack of family support.', 'label': 'c'}\n",

In high school, I never dated, because I felt I wasn't good enough. Now in college, I've been having these problems become more intense. My body image issues are growing (I can't look at myself and not feel disgusted), I started cutting my wrists, and I went about a week without eating anything.Now, I don't feel attracted to that many people. And when I find someone attractive, I usually have an intense draw to them. I cannot tell if that's normal, or if those feelings are just what a crush is. I feel as if most people can look around and point out who they find attractive; whereas, I don't find many people attractive and they pretty much just look the same (as in I have a type).At the beginning of this year, on of my fellow Resident Advisers told me that one of her residents thought I was cute. Of course I just could not believe it, since who could possibly find me attractive? Long story short, I've been talking to this guy, and last Wednesday he came over to my room to watch a movie. Things got a little heated and we started making out (my first kiss at age 20... another reason why I'm pathetic), and I had to stop him when he started taking off my shirt.Truth is, I wish I felt comfortable about sex and exposing my body.

Here's my process:1. I know that I won't go to hell because it doesn't exist/god doesn't exist. Even if he does, many Christians think that he accepts gays. But then I wonder, what if they're wrong? What if he isn't just and he'll punish me forever in eternal pain in hell for being in a gay relationship?2. Even if I do accept that logically this makes no sense, what if I can't get out of this? What if I have to end a relationship with a girl I'm in love with to fix this? I've had issues with this before and come out of it, but it almost cost me my life.

Everyone back home thinks I'm having a grand time, tearing apart Europe and making movies, like i said i would. For three months i hid in my room and tried my best to distance myself from my family. The only thing i cared about was trying to stay thin and browsing reddit and Facebook and trying to stay in touch with the few friends i have back home. Im so tired of all of this. My whole life I've struggled to accomplish anything, amount to anything, or do anything but weigh people down by being an unappreciative and disrespectful burden on people. I destroyed my moms life. I was the thorn in her marriage and i wouldn't let her be happy. I was a bully to my brother, and took out my anger and frustration on the both of them. All throughout high school i let one failed relationship hold me back from being happy and getting good grades. I barley graduated. Things were going good for a little bit. I graduated and all of the stress and failure and depression was gone. My mom found out i tried hanging myself, and i got brief counseling. I was cured. I made up with my mom. Days before i was leaving for Germany. For god knows how long. I know i belonged back home. There i was happy. I had my family, my friends. And everything that i have come to known. I left it all behind. Now I've been doing nothing but sit in my room and browse the internet and destroy my body with bulimia. Ive gained a lot of weight from that. Wasted so much food and for what? A false sense of security? Guarantee i would be good looking? No. I can't function properly as a young adult. Im still a spoiled, bratty little child deep inside. Im not prepared for the world. I can't survive a DAY on my own. I can't accomplish anything other than destroying peoples lives. I don't appreciate the life that i was given. I do appreciate my family, and my friends. I hope this is just another emotional breakdown. There is a part of me that wants to continue, a part of me that is exited that some of my friends are coming to visit, and we make a wicked road trip doc. But I'm just to weak. I can't take it anymore. I need to lie down. I feel like i can't breathe. I want to be home. I want my friends back. I want my life to start already. I don't know what i want. I don't want to destroy my mothers life any further after we made up. I dont want to leave my grandparents, i doubt they will be able to recover.

I am not entirely sure if this belongs more in r/depression, but I\\'ll post it there too and if this is in the wrong subreddit feel free to delete it. My goal is to help you from going down the path I came very close to taking.A little background: Between 2005 and today, I have been depressed. I have harmed myself. I have thought about how much better life would be if it were over. I have entered suicide pacts. I have attended hundreds of hours of counselling and therapy, and for the past year and a half I have been taking anti-depressants. It peaked in 2007 when I was less than a week away from setting a plan in motion to end it all. I will not bore you with the details, but a friend of mine passed away that year and it began to change my perspective. Though I was barely motivated to do so, I scrapped my plan, and begun to try to live my life in a way that would make my friend proud, since to do otherwise would cause the same amount of pain to my friends and family as his death did to me. I will not lie to you. I have since had my bad days. I sometimes sit inside a \\'dark tunnel\\' for hours, with no light at the end of it and just feel totally helpless and am unable to do anything with my day except struggle. I forget about everything that matters to me, and my problems are amplified. I engage in a VERY zero-sum thinking.My therapist recommended I try and think positive thoughts to fight these kind of days, since some would get particularly awful. I went a step further and compiled a list of what I call \"Things to Remember\" in the event that these bad days occur. So without further ado...* **It will get better.** Depression might seem like it is permanent, but a light exists at the end of the tunnel.-You are human. The pain you feel is very real, but you can get past it.* **People care about you.** Whether you believe this or not, it\\'s true. And you care about them in return. Do not let them down.-Do your best, whatever that may be.-Do not give in, despite how much you might want to. YOU CAN DO IT.-Be yourself. No matter what, people will always be proud of you.-To quote the late Dr. _PERSON_: \"Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don\\'t matter and those who matter don\\'t mind.\"* There are always options and ways out that are not as extreme as what you are thinking of.-Try to think short term, like running a marathon. Just one more kilometre (I\\'m Canadian) or mile...-You are NOT alone. Not only is reddit here for you, but you have family and friends who are more than happy to help shoulder your burdens.* Failure or uncertainty does not mean the end of the world. Take things on at your own pace.* **You are awesome.** Do not let anyone or anything make you think otherwise.* **Live life the way you want to live it.** Every day is your own. In other words: *_PERSON_** **If you need help, ask for it.** The people who care about you will be there for you, no matter what.* **Do not bottle up your feelings inside.*** **Take advantage of the good days.**One other thing I would recommend is to make a list of things that make you happy, even though, as I know myself, that when depression is in full swing it is hard to think about. But it can be the simplest of things that life has to offer. These are all reasons worth living.TL;DR: Remember, people love you. People care about you. People will cry when you are gone. They are one of the many reasons to live.Edit 1: I\\'m an epic fail at reddit formatting, apparently.', 'label': 'b'}\n",

I just have to focus entirely on the 3rd exam and hope to the fucking heavens that I get an A, so I can come out of this class with a B, which would instead screw me over just a bit. I can't deal with this fucking failure. Thank god I have a wine bottle to calm myself down and not get into a depression.\", 'label': 'b'}\n",

Last year round 18bday I slept with my friends mom. She and I had a year long relationship, rings, ohana, the whole nine yards. _PERSON_ was pissed understandably. _PERSON_ me out. Estranged relationship there. Rambling now. I moved to tn from nc to find work to help her. I was depressed and abused alcohol. A month after the move 5 days after my bday. On June 24 she wanted to see other people. Next day she fucked a dude. It was only not long ago I knew her for who she was. A right now kind of woman. Funny you\\'d think a guy my age 19, would be the right now cheating type as opposed to a 40 old woman, wrong. Some kids grow up to be just bigger kids. Some kids never have a chance to be a kid. Funny eh? I\\'m on pill #15. I\\'m so lost and so hopeless. I\\'ve made so many wrong choices. So many bad judgements. Hurt and disappointed so much. I\\'m done for now. If I live I\\'ll check all my \"OMG your an idiot nightsaber \" comments. If not, then just read it as a fictional depressing story and go on your way. Everyone did my last 2 attempts... EDIT: This is the part where i sheepishly return to let everyone know I couldn\\'t do it. The very moment I posted this momma contacted me, and I just couldnt, do it knowing that she\\'d lose her oldest son. I had 3 superheros last night. My Bro Herman back in NC, an old love, _PERSON_, not mentioned above, and _PERSON_ (no last names for anonymity) . Sorry guys for getting all worked up and making others worry as a result. It was a bit selfish of myself for wanting an out so badly I would disregard how it made others feel. Primal in a way. But what happened happened. Again, sorry all. Last time I felt this low I took a .22 in a field and sat for a bit thinking about it all. But that time i had a little bit more going for me than I do right now. So 15 was my last pill, i threw up 15 minutes after posting and bouncing back at a pretty decent pace from my judgement. Just one last time, Sorry everybody.', 'label': 'd'}\n",

So, me and my girlfriend have been together for almost two years. We\\'ve had our ups and downs but in the end, we\\'ve always been there for each other. Recently however, for the past few months, her anxiety and panic disorders have both increased and she has been getting anxious and panicky more frequently than ever. About a year ago she moved out of her parents house and moved into an apartment complex closer to her school. It went well at first and she was able to pay rent on time, no financial stress or anything of the matter. As time went on, it got stressful though because she wasn\\'t able to pay off rent in time or was left with only $50 to last her the next two weeks. That added to her stress and I believe her anxiety as well. About a month or two ago, she got a cat and had it registered as a service animal. Her roommate let her keep it \"as long as it was a kitten\" but when she saw it, made up an excuse that she was allergic to cats and didn\\'t want it there. It was already signed into the lease and she was paying extra for it to stay there but she decided to leave the apartment when one of her other roommates said that the roommate \"allergic to cats\" wanted to leave then front doors and my girlfriends door open around the house so the cat could get out. Making that the last straw, she decided to move out. Looking for a place to stay and me helping her along the way added even more stress to her already stressful situation. Me and my girlfriend, as I said, have been together for almost 2 years. We have had our ups and downs and there was a time we didn\\'t see each other for over 8 months. Causing our relationship to become long distance. I have a problem with my anger, and I\\'ve been stressed out recently trying to pay rent at my dads house, trying to pay off something personal I owe and working three jobs while also trying to make time to see her. Unfortunately, and I\\'m not afraid to admit the truth, I know my anger problems have led to her anxiety and panic disorder being more serious. There are times I _PERSON_ can\\'t control what I say. I\\'m not physically abusive, in no way could I ever hit her. But, I am verbally abusive. When I\\'m angry, I seek to hurt her and say things that I know are mean. Its rare that I get to that point where I\\'m verbally abusing her but I can be very mean and hurtful and I known that has lead to her anxiety being more serious. There are times where she does things that are very unwise and even dumb. I tell her buy she gets very upset very fast. For example, she was \"scared\" to look at her bank account after spending a rather large amount of money on something and only after some days and me constantly reminding her to look, she finally checked her account and saw she owed over $205+ dollars in overdraft fees, then she couldn\\'t pay rent because over 50% of her paycheck went into into paying the overdraft fees and she didn\\'t want to go to the bank to get overdraft forgiveness or ask to put a hold on her card because she\\'s too anxious to talk to people. That leaves me frustrated and angry because I know she\\'s just losing money. I know i can\\'t just say \"Stop being anxious\" because that isn\\'t how it works. It\\'s difficult not to say that though when I\\'m angry. Certain things she does not do that is common sense to anyone else is what frustrates me but when I tell her she thinks I\\'m mad and then she starts getting angry and saying its not her fault she has a disorder and that I should not be mad at her it\\'s her disorder, not her. I want to help her but I\\'m not good at dealing with her when I\\'m upset. I don\\'t know how to be there for her when she\\'s anxious or panicky. I know its simple but when I\\'m angry its hard. I say things I regret when I\\'m angry, so when I\\'m starting to get angry, I know and I try to tell her. I ask her to give me at least 5-10 minutes to calm down and get my mind off it so I don\\'t get worse and say things I\\'ll regret. Unfortunately though, she just keeps talking and won\\'t be respectful to my wishes. She says, to her, that when I\\'m upset she chooses to talk about it to solve it, and if we don\\'t talk she will start to get anxious and panic, while I choose to just stop talking and ask for a few minutes. She likes to talk it out right away, I don\\'t. And because of that, it makes our arguments 100000 times worse because it gets me mad that she can\\'t respect what I ask, and that\\'s to be left alone so I can calm down. Then because I\\'m angry, shes she gets more panicky because I\\'m angry, then goes on to blame me for making her panic because I \"don\\'t want to talk it out\" and say things like, \"All I\\'m trying to do is talk it out and be nice but you\\'re angry and yelling at me\". It upsets me when she says these things because it\\'s been almost two years. She will also say I don\\'t love her which is untrue. I\\'ve been there for her since day one. And she should know by now how I get when I\\'m angry. I have thought about taking anger management classes and now more then ever I\\'m considering it. I will post in comments more.', 'label': 'a'}\n",

A year ago Saturday, someone else I knew committed suicide. That person and I weren't on speaking terms at the time, but I was still heart-broken, and I still am. I woke up this morning thinking of her, and I knew the date of her death was coming up...I was going to try and look at the world differently for her, and imagine her at peace instead of imaging the pain she must have felt when she decided to end her life. But then, another friend of mine committed suicide. I found out today. About 2 or 3 weeks ago, I talked her down from suicide. I only knew her through the internet, but she was more of a friend than most people in my real life have ever been. I thought she was doing better. I hadn't heard from her in awhile, but that was normal. She'd pop up on LJ every few weeks. I just can't believe she's gone. From the world. She'll never... be... anything again. She'll never breathe or sleep. It's terrifying. I'm so afraid of losing people to mental illness. I have two people in my life right now who are struggling with depression and suicide more than they ever have before, and it scares me. I worry about them so much, because I truly don't know what I would do without them in this world. Lately I've been so worried about them, and then this happens. Reminding me, yet again, that life is incredibly fragile and that I can't fix everything. And I don't like it.I was suicidal earlier this week. I'm suicidal on a regular basis. But not to the extent that I used to be. I used to want to kill myself every. single. night. I never thought I'd make it past 18, but now I'm 20. I never thought I'd have any nights where I could lay in bed, in the dark, and not want to die. But I have them now. Things changed. They did. Not without effort, but they changed. I still struggle with depression (Bipolar II) and suicidal thoughts and other things--I don't believe any of those things will ever go away (and who knows, they could come back full-force someday)--but right now, I am okay. I never thought I would be, but I am.So please... don't give up. Not just because losing someone to suicide is an absolutely horrible feeling, especially if you _PERSON_ what they felt before they attempted (I've attempted suicide 3 times), but because it can get better. I HATE it when people say that to me when I'm depressed, but... I have to remember to tell myself that feelings past. They don't last forever. Even if they only let up for a few moments each day, live for those moments. Live for the days when those moments won't be as infrequent as they are now. I promise you, that someday, things will be different. I promise you, I do understand. So many people have come back from worse things than I could ever imagine--and they're okay today. It is possible. So please... just remember, in those moments where everything feels absolutely hopeless, that it isn't. It truly is not. Even if you usually can't see that, deep down, you know. You know that things can be different someday.\", 'label': 'b'}\n",

I know everyone here just wants to help. That\\'s great. Amazing, in fact. Reddit is such a great and caring community, and I mean that in the most sincerest of ways.

But do **not** pretend to know what it\\'s like to be depressed and *definitely* don\\'t act like you\\'re a qualified psychologist.It\\'s true that everyone gets depressed from time to time. \"She broke up with me, my life is over!\" or \"My kitteh died, I\\'m so sad!\" are normal \"depressions\" for us all. Clinical depression, however, is an entirely different issue. Just because you\\'ve been sad before does **not** mean you know what true depression is like. And when you try to give \"hope\" to people suffering from it based on that misconception, well, you\\'re doing more harm than good.Clinical depression that leads to suicidal ideation is a very serious psychological disorder. Serious thought of suicide is not normal. The deep hole, the black dog that is clinical depression, is not something one can simply snap their fingers at to get out of. My friends, I know you all mean well. But please, stop making posts that belittle this curse. While I admire the fact that you want to help I feel insulted by many of these recent posts from people who think this is just a game that is limited to only adolescents. I am 30 years old and I have struggled with depression my entire life.Instead, why not just hang out in the comments sections of /r/suicidewatch/new? Just talk to those who are seriously depressed and suicidal. Offer an ear. Give positive feedback.But this recent spate of \"Hey, I was sad yesterday because my dog died but now I\\'m happy! You can be, too!\" posts need to stop. If you haven\\'t suffered from true clinical depression, you have no idea what it\\'s like. And shame on you for pretending that you do because you\\'re hurting the cause, not helping it.', 'label': 'b'}\n",

I started experiencing some symptoms of depression when I was 17. Started therapy in October of 2011 and turned 18 towards the end of October. Was recommended by my therapist to see a psychiatrist at his firm, psychiatrist diagnosed me with major depression in late November/early December. Started treatment to try and kick the depression.Obviously I'm here because everything has failed. I turned 19 3 months ago and am still deep in depression. I've switched psychiatrists once partway through 2012 and I like my new psychiatrist a lot more but nothing seems to help with my depression, though the sleeping aid I've been taking seems to be helping some. Most of the anti-depressants I've taken have either helped only a little, none, or made me feel worse until I got off them.I identify as gay and came out in 2011 around the time I started therapy, and I think trying to accept this aspect of me helped throw me into depression in the first place. Towards the end of August in 2011 my best friend also tried to kill himself though another friend and I managed to save his life by contacting emergency authorities in time to reach him. I believe that was another big factor that sent me overboard into depression. I also have really bad anxiety at times, though it was mostly a problem before I graduated. It was crippling and painful at times, I'd go whole days where my stomach was just sick and I'd feel agony because I was so anxious. I also struggle with some possible transgender issues though I can't figure out my feelings regarding them. They are tearing me apart recently though and I can't seem to shake them even though I tell myself it doesn't matter right now.So basically, depressed for well over a year now, no end in sight as I don't seem to be getting better and have actually been getting worse again as winter deepens. I feel like there's no hope and I feel stupid and worthless all the time. I have trouble getting out of bed and I have trouble motivating myself to do things. Activities I used to enjoy such as video games or reading have diminished to the point where I haven't read since I became depressed and play maybe 1 game a day. The rest of my time is spent trying to talk to friends or staring at the walls listening to music. I spend a great deal of my time lying in bed because I feel so bad and can't bring myself to do anything, nor enjoy it if I manage to.Still try to go out for walks most days with my mom since I can't run anymore due to painful shin splints. She and my father have both been supportive of my depression and my gayitude.Despite this I've felt myself slipping. Lately all I think about is being dead, killing myself, ways I would hurt myself. I tell all this to my friends and my psychiatrist but unfortunately they all admit to not knowing what to say and I don't blame them. I want to make it all end and have the bad feelings stop.Just looking for some shoulders I guess...\", 'label': 'c'}\n",

After breaking up with my first boyfriend (i'm 26 &amp; this very brief relationship meant more to me than him) I weakly tried to slit my wrist. It was determined that the medicine I was on a huge contributing factor, but when they tried to figure out something else to give me, I refused. I was done with psychotic meds and the mood swings. I just can't try anything else so foreign to my body that brought me so close to the edge. So I started intensive group therapy._PERSON_ and behold, my insurance decides not to pay for my treatment. So at $600 a day, I was forced to quit. Why should my problems strain the pockets of my mother who is trying to help? And now I'm here in the Starbucks parking lot just watching the sun disappear and taking in every moment of the evening before I have to go home and do what i need to do to stop this.Today I woke up thinking that I was going to date myself. That I was going to try to fall in love with everything about me so that these seemingly small relationship failures would stop hitting me so hard. So I paid myself a compliment, put on some nice clothes and went to work. But I still couldn't get the person I used to date out of my mind and desperately want to. I'm not thought about nor was I really cared for. I was just a rebound from his previous relationship. No big deal right?It is a big deal to a person who has never really had anyone want her for real. It's a big deal to someone who is pretty careful about letting people in and once I care, they drop me. It's a big deal to someone who, on her own, has pretty high self esteem and has been on this track of learning to love herself only to just let it all shatter once I think I'm ready to be intimate and try. I just can't get it right. It's no one's fault how they treat me but mine. It's my fault and because of my personality and lack of luck that I end up with the people I've been with. And even though I know that time will heal this, I don't want it to. I'm tired of figuring out what it is about me that causes history to repeat itself and why some people with similar problems are able to find supportive partners.  It's made me think that all of this is to due with circumstance, chance and luck. And I'm not one of the lucky.After secretly crying at work, I decided I was going to go to the park to get my homework done and to stay away from the internet (namely Facebook). But when I got there, I couldn't focus. Then a young couple  pulled up, walked to the river lovingly and sit at a bench, embracing each other. It couldn't have been perfect timing. I cried. Then left. Then cried so hard I had to pull over, during which I screamed multiple times as I have never screamed before. Finally I decided I'd had it. I'd drive and get the fattiest drink on the Starbucks menu, enjoy the view and once I got home, I'd finally be done. It's like a weight has lifted off my shoulders. I called the suicide hotline but that was a no go. They offered to call back and check on me but I would rather that I wasn't there to pick up the phone. If suffering is human then I don't want to be human anymore. I didn't ask for this (at least to my knowledge.) When you have a mental illness, the up and down is unbearable. I guess I couldn't do this on my own. And I refuse to burden anyone else who has tried to help me.Thanks for taking the time to read this. Even if you don't comment, it was nice to have been heard.

I know that isn\\'t typical of a person with thoughts of suicide, but maybe today is just one of my better days.And having a decent life is also a part of why I want to end it some days, if that makes any sense. I\\'ll try to explain.When things do start to pile up and drag me down (which happens almost cyclically, though I haven\\'t yet identified any trigger of sorts), I usually turn to other friends who have similar issues or I look online for help. What often happens is that I witness people feeling the same way that I do, only over much worse (I feel almost objectively) circumstances. It\\'s then that I start to feel bad for feeling bad, y\\'know? \"His problems are so much harder and more painful than mine, yet here he is still,\" would be something I say to myself often. Then I start to feel like a villain, almost, because I\\'m contemplating suicide over what seem like trivial matters by comparison.My point, I suppose, is that I have issues with seeing the good in my life and often feel very depressed over the bad. Then, when I am reminded of the good, I feel even worse for having let it go unnoticed and start to spiral further downward.I\\'m not fully certain what I\\'m looking for. I\\'ll gladly answer any questions about specific details if you think you can help with any of my problems.For my basic problems, however:* How can I better see the happiness in life and appreciate it more?* If I am having troubles appreciating niceties, should I consider being tested for depression or something similar?* Part of my sadness stems from receiving little to no results from my hard work and efforts (in a few different areas). Is this a sign I should give up or just keep fighting harder?Thanks, and I hope you\\'re doing okay yourself.', 'label': 'b'}\n",

He (a FtM transgender; I'm an otherwise cishet male) was in a theatre performance in our hometown where he still lives for now, so I came to see it as I promised I would a while ago.We haven't spoken in three weeks. Three Fridays ago we left on a sour note after he canceled plans we had to get breakfast last-minute. Besides the small spat the cancellation caused, we'd been on solidly good terms for several weeks. A couple days later I sent him a text while I was playing a trivia game with some friends. A question came up and I knew the answer, but only because it was something he had told me a long time ago when we were still together.Since then I've half-deliberately avoided any contact. We've both been busy -- him with theatre, me with school, and both of us with life in general. I had hoped tonight would be a refreshing moment, because when last we spoke I think we both would have called ourselves great close friends still.I went to see him when the show was over after saying hey to a few other people I knew there. He came and offered a hug, which I returned. And the feelings rushed back into me again. Things I hadn't felt in a while and that I thought were all but gone. And the thing about the hug was that I could tell that he felt nothing similar. I tried to convey my excitement and happiness for his performance, but it felt ill-received as I was kinda pushed aside.I thought I was past this. I've gone out with and chatted up several other people in the past few weeks. I felt like I was over him, like I was whole again, y'know? But after tonight, I'm not so certain.I generally run pretty low, emotionally speaking. Suicide is an almost daily consideration of mine. I have a necklace with a charm that means a lot to me that I wear when I need an extra boost to get through my day. I haven't taken it off, outside of showering, in almost a month. I keep poking my thumb on its pointed end to make sure it still hurts. All I can think of is taking the pointed end somewhere else on my skin and just letting it destroy me. I'm not trying to sound poetic to make a statement, but writing has always been one of my coping mechanisms.In regards to my ex, I feel like I still want to be with him more than anything. If we can manage to just be best friends, that's okay, too, especially since we'd been just that for a couple of months without many complications.No one has ever known or understood me -- my passions, my dreams, my quirks, or my pain -- like he has/did. And at this moment, I'm still honestly convinced that nobody ever will.I want to die. I want to be done with all of this. Knowing that he either can't or simply won't be here to stop me, I want to disappear that much more.Please. If you've read this far and have any real and sincere advice to offer, I'm open to suggestions.Thanks for listening, Reddit. Not many others would.\", 'label': 'b'}\n",

My gorgeous fantastic SO, bless her heart, has been trying EVERYTHING to help me and I can see her getting extremely frustrated with me. My friends either refuse to acknowledge that I have a problem, or are too busy with their own lives and I don't want to burden them. (I do have one friend who has a wife with depression who is trying to help me and I fully appreciate it, but I don't see the point right now) My family is old-school and refuse to beleive I have any 'reason' to be depressed.My question is, are there such places as mental health hospitals that I can check myself into or be admited to where I can just, I don't know, go stay in a little white room with padded walls for a week and just read books and be away from everything for a little while?Do such places exist and if so are they free to check into or is this something that is expensive and would bankrupt my already financially strapped family like councilling is going to _PERSON_ feel like i'm running out of options here and if I don't do something soon I don't know.. but i'm starting to scare myself and I don't like it.If anyone can help with my question I would really appreciate it because I have nowhere else to turn.\", 'label': 'c'}\n",

I have compulsive behavior where I overspend, and I fear people will hate me for it (no - it's not cheating or drug addiction or anything bad done to anybody else save myself, but I can't say what it is out fear if being discovered). I take Clonazepam and Cymbalta for my condition, but I find myself still worrying a lot about what could happen if I'm discovered (like if my wife finds out that I owe money to a lady we both know and can't pay her back, or if she calls her and tells her about the debt and she throws me out of her life).

I've attempted ending it before with tranquilizer overdoses and this time around I feel like I have no escape.

She spoke vile things about him to me and to many others then. She left him and moved in with a 60-year-old man. The same thing happened. I mention the age due to the difference, but know that age doesn\\'t always matter.Last year i suffered a broken ankle, and since my family did not help, as they\\'re very wealthy and see me like a burden (even with my brother and sister telling me to go kill myself, and I\\'m not joking) - she sent me funds from the UK which I accepted only after she insisted many times. Then I became bait. One day she suddenly buys her ticket to where I live, and we move in together. Every day she wrote me very long emails saying how she wants to be with me for eternity, etc.. I knew that she had a pretty extreme way of thinking, as she\\'s pretty much a militant vegan, believes that she\\'ll live to be at least 200, and is not human, but from an extraterrestrial species - no joke. I did not know that she was being very serious about these last two points, and she seemed pretty sane when she said that.I was very emotionally vulnerable back then and accepted her coming over here. Then hell ensued. She would throw a tantrum every other day, tried to control me in every way she could. I could not get a haircut. I could only wear shorts, sandals, and a t-shirt. I had to eat exactly what she ate, etc.. I could not call my friends from within the house because she would hear everything.The situation got so bad that I started drinking heavily and gambling, and I\\'m not addicted to either. The latter I stopped completely, but I still have a couple of whiskeys or beers now and then just to forget.Anyway, this girl is clearly not emotionally/mentally stable in any sense. The foul things she tells me are horrible. I\\'ve never been told that \"your family had to stand you all your life - poor them\" or \"I can\\'t believe how your job put up with you for so many years\". These words hurt horribly and despite this, I still love her (or I think I do) and now she wants to file for divorce, as I didn\\'t change the way she wanted me to in 1 year. We\\'ve been married for about 5 months. I feel guilty. I started smoking more, drinking more, etc.. because she was making me lose my mind. Or because I let her make me lose my mind.She had huge tantrums - one in particular - where she started banging the walls and screaming like she was possessed after I told her - peacefully - that I felt like ending myself. That this is too much. Everybody advised me to call the police. I did not.Now she\\'s abroad and extended her trip until the 6th. She claims to be asexual, and I know asexual people - I went through an asexual phase myself - and she\\'s anything but that. She\\'s probably getting laid by somebody else and this thought rips me to pieces, because if there was one good thing in our relationship it was sex once a month or once every two months. That\\'s when one feels closer to the partner, and it\\'s horrible to think this.Right now, she\\'s probably fucking some guy on her trip and writing vile things about me to everybody. I never ever did anything wrong to her - my conscience is clear. On the other hand, she destroyed me, yet I still have feelings for this person. I feel used and trampled on, and the thought of her writing to a whole bunch of people - maybe even my more normal family members - made me literally vomit.I have a history of overdosing and once I almost jumped off a building. Now that I have the apartment to myself i feel like tying this nuzzle to the roof and just ending it, but I cannot pull through the act. I married her to rebuild my trust in people, as I\\'ve been used over and over agaii. I thought it would be different this time around. People let me down constantly, and I\\'m scared shitless of hurting myself beacuse It\\'s been 35 years of hell.Any advice would be welcome, and no, I am not trying to play the victim.

The school semester is about to start, I don\\'t want to drop out, but I can\\'t do anything because of this depression/anxiety. I turned 16 during June so I was legally allowed to drop out. Fast forward to today, I\\'m always at home doing nothing (bored as hell all the time), my 14 year old brother thinks I\\'m a failure, my 7 year old brother is attached to me and I wanna die. I don\\'t want to mess up my 7 year old brother. Oh and also when I told my mom I wanted to die, she said she wouldn\\'t be able to live without me and would take her own life too. Now I don\\'t know what to do. I\\'ve tried everything related to treatment, nothing works, I just want to die but I don\\'t want my brothers to live without a mother.TL;DR: I come from a family where everyone is either a doctor and engineer (\"successful\") while I\\'m a drop out. Social anxiety, stress due to exams and an addiction to video games caused me to drop out. I\\'ve tried all remedies for depression, nothing works. I really want to die, but my 7 year old brother is attached to me and my mother says she\\'ll commit suicide too if I do it. I don\\'t want to mess up my little brother/mom. I don\\'t know what to do.Sorry for boring you with my life.EDIT: Error', 'label': 'c'}\n",

For the last few years my life has been nothing short of hell. A college dropout with absolutely no skills, no job or hope of ever finding one. I have been living with almost no income for 2 years now, and the little money i have been able to earn from the little work i found here and there was at no point enough for even rent and bills, let alone anything else.  For 2 whole years i haven't had a decent meal, most of them consisted of several slices of bread + just a little something to make it bearable. I can't even remember the last time i bought a peace of clothing, shoes, ...  It's just tiring. Eating same old disgusting food day after day, wearing the same old worn out clothes, shoes with countless holes in them that you could smell from meters away, not being able to go out for a drink with friends, ... Just 2 god damn years without a single good thing happening to me, a single thing to brighten up my day. Nothing but 24 hours a day of anxiety, worrying, depression, suicidal thoughts. Those things take a toll on a person, both physically and mentally.  My health has deteriorated, and with no health insurance i haven't even been able to afford a visit to a doctor. I have lost about 20kg and i'm currently down to 60.  Mental part is even worse than physical. Constant anxiety and feeling of impending doom, almost having a heart-attack every time someone rings a doorbell or i receive a phonecall... No person should live like this.  I have alienated myself from most of my friends, but feeling like shit and not having any money haven't given me the opportunity to hang out much.  The only one i still see everyday is my best friend/roommate, who, i'm afraid, has also grown to resent me because of the money i borrowed from him about a year ago and still haven't been able to repay.  To make things ever worse, i'm several months behind on rent and bills, and today should finally be the day i get kicked out and left with nothing.  I don't know what to do, i just can't live like this anymore. I have tried taking my life before, pills did absolutely nothing and i couldn't grow ball to jump off the building. Finally got some rope, but just my luck, i don't even have a place to tie it to and hang myself.  No idea what to do next.

I met my best friend, _PERSON_, in preschool, we became extremely close pretty much immediately. Hung out constantly, introduced me to his friends and life was good. My parents divorced, and I went with my _PERSON_ to a new town an hours drive away. We arranged that I'd come down to visit every two weeks for the weekend and every two years I'd switch with parent I lived with. Every weekend I came home he'd have left answering messages on my phone asking me to hang out and every weekend we would. When I started high school my dad convinced me to stay with him and not move back for the next two years. So for the rest of my high school life all my real friends lived an hours drive away, and I saw them only four days a month. I made some friends in high school, but now I realize they weren't more then acquaintances. I was happy though, my best friend was awesome and I was cute and aloof so I got some attention from girls. I saw a future for myself, I went to the gym, I cared about how I looked, and when I went home on the weekend people would scream my name when I showed up at a party. I was happy. Then _PERSON_ hung himself. It came out of nowhere, and It devastated me. He had asked me to come visit him about a week before, and I turned him down because I had to work that weekend. I've always had trouble managing my life. Work, finance, health, social. All of these facets of my life were in a constant state of procrastination, however I at least had my intellectualism and passion. I could focus on something that I was passionate about for hours, I'd start work on a project and forget food, sleep, sex, anything. Since _PERSON_ passed its all gotten much worse, every facet of my life that I could barely manage before has transitioned into complete chaos. I lost my passion, I lost my intellect. I can't focus for minutes. If someone handed me a 500 Page book and said all the answers to my life are scattered in it, I'd read half a paragraph and give up. Before all of this I could excuse my bad habits, my nearly complete lack of control in my life because at least I was skilled at what I was passionate over. Now I feel like I can't talk to people. I feel completely alone, like the words I'm speaking mean something else to other people. I can't maintain a relationship at all, friendly or romantic. No one calls me any more, no one asks me to do anything, I have no best friend, I have no one I consider a particularity good friend. For fuck sakes, I used to be a half decent writer too and this is coming out as a scattered mess. Now I don't know what I can do, what I am, how I'm valuable, the only reason I'm alive is because of fear. My own cowardice and fear of hurting my mother. I don't know what to do, I don't know what I want, I don't even know why I'm still alive. I don't know how to climb out of this hole I'm in.

Right now I am just desperate for some advice and insight because I have no where else to turn. I\\'ve always had issues making friends. Always. Ever since I was in elementary school. I would make friends and then lose them or not make any at all. I always blamed not making friends on my shyness and not keeping friends on other people just being assholes. I think that that was true in elementary school but I\\'m not so sure about beyond that. In elementary school I actually had 3 friends that at different points in time were my best friends. Then one day they all decided that they were too cool for me. I\\'m not sure if your elementary school was anything like mine, but even back then cliques were already forming. I remember clearly that 2 of them turned from me because I wasn\\'t accepted into the \"popular\" group. The first one I was friends with for a few years and then one she left and came back. When she came back, I was sitting at lunch one day and said her name to get her attention so I could talk to her and she said \"WHAT\" like Oh my god why are talking to me voice. Then the second one was friends with me for a year and then the next year when we came back to school I went to talk to her at recess and she literally twisted her face up at me and gave me a weird look like \"what are you doing talking to me\". I will never forget that. That one hurt the most tbh. The third one was because she was completely selfish. By the time I was in middle school, I had switched schools because we moved out of state. I had issues making friends (I think) because of my shyness. I made some good friends there. I actually really miss it. However, I spent all my summers and most of my weekends by myself at home on the computer. At the end of my 8th grade year we moved back to the same county as before. I was forced to make new friends with people that I had already failed to make friends with before. I made a group of \"friends\" that got me through high school, but again, I spent my summers and most of my weekends by myself alone...on the computer. And it really upset me because this group of \"friends\" would spend all kinds of time together over the summer and on weekends but would never invite me. They would even make elaborate plans in front of me, but never even think to invite me. It really hurt my feelings. Now I\\'m in college. My freshman year I lived on campus. I went out of my way to talk to people during orientation and say hi and everything because I really wanted to establish a group of friends. I was really determined. Well, then I found myself half way through orientation week with no group of friends while everyone else had a group. I mean, sure, they probably weren\\'t close life long friends, but they at least had something to lean on considering everyone there was new to each other. I felt so lost. (it\\'s a small school btw).  I became friends with my roommate. We\\'re still friends and we talk on facebook and hang out sometimes, but sometimes I feel like she just talks to me because she\\'s somewhat in the same boat that I am. At school, we have each other and another girl from China (which I don\\'t seem to click with that well not sure why. She\\'s super sweet though. There\\'s nothing wrong with her.) except my roommate seems to have people in class that she can talk to for help and whatever or just small talk while I don\\'t. I sit in class, take notes, leave. I\\'ll be a junior this year and the same thing happened last year, except I don\\'t live on campus anymore. Work is another hell story. When I first started at my first job, I liked it. I thought I got along with everybody. Then I found out from a fellow employee about 6 months later that this guy that I thought I was cool with was talking massive shit behind my back and she made it sound like him talking shit was actually making other people hate me. She started after me and worked with him before she worked with me and she admitted to me that she never  gave me a chance and felt sorry about it because she was wrong. And then she told me that he was saying that I was lazy and blah blah blah which isn\\'t even true. She said that she\\'s gotten a few people to realize that what he was saying was bullshit (although I still feel like those people still hate me), but that there\\'s this one girl that she can\\'t get to change her mind. which was really weird to me because I had never worked with that girl so i didn\\'t know why she didn\\'t like me. Well, there was a lot of drama with her (long story short she changed the schedule so she\\'d get more hours than me). I just feel like after that, I can\\'t trust anybody there. The people that I thought I was on good terms with, now I feel like are actually talking behind my back but never saying it to my face. I just don\\'t know what to say. And then I got a second job and I\\'ve worked 2 shifts and hate it. The workers aren\\'t very friendly or helpful. I\\'ve had a couple talk to me, but it\\'s very superficial and they don\\'t seem interested at all. I will probably end up quiting my second job, but I can\\'t quit my first because I get 27 hours there which I desperately need to pay for my phone, my car loan, and my gas to get back and forth to school (about 100 miles a day). The only support system I really have is my boyfriend, but when I try to talk to him about this stuff he\\'s not all that helpful. He doesn\\'t know how to deal with it. I mean, he\\'s a loving guy, but he just doesn\\'t get it. All he says is \"you just need to be happy\". My sister is never home and she\\'s too involved in her friends\\' lives to genuinely care about what I have to say. I try to hold a conversation with her and before I can finish what I have to say, she\\'s got her nose in her phone. I try talking to my mom everyday about just simple things that went on in my day, but all she does is look at me and then look away without saying anything or she just doesn\\'t even look at me at all. I\\'ve tried addressing this several time but she either ignores it or tells me I\\'m being overdramatic. I\\'ve told her once I wanted to kill myself and I literally got yelled at in my face for it. I can\\'t talk to my dad because he\\'s just not someone I can go to about this stuff. And my brother and I hate each other. I am just absolutely desperate for help. Please somebody respond. i feel so stupid and helpless.', 'label': 'c'}\n",

Note: the friend in question lives 1500 miles away, before anyone asks.As I run over the events of tonight, I keep feeling worse about it. A friend of mine has had a pretty rough life the last few years. Let me preface this by saying she does not trust people and hardly lets anyone in. Two years ago she was held hostage in her own home as they were robbed and things with her (now ex) boyfriend started to sour because she was unable to cope with the robbery. Eventually they ended up breaking up a year later. After this happened she started to slip into darkness; she had suicidal thoughts and actions. The only person she ever really loved threw her out. She and I were not in touch at this point because she made a kind of crazy agreement with him that she would not talk to other guys if he agreed not to talk to other girls. (She was quite the jealous type.)Fast forward to more recent times. She was doing better, but definitely not doing well. She had made progress, but she still wasn't completely normal (whatever that really means). She still pined over her ex, unrealistically hoping that he'd take her back even though he made it clear he had no intention of dating her or anyone else for a long time. I tried to do my best as a friend to support her, though I made it clear that she should probably begin to move on. Two to three weeks ago they met and had lunch. Eventually the topic of getting back together came up and he lashed out at her and made it painfully obvious that they would not date. Yet even with this she refused to believe that they wouldn't get back together.Fast forward to last week. After some huge blowout, he finally cut ties completely with her. Needless to say she did not take it well and I ended up having to pick up the pieces. She voiced her desire to kill herself. I tried to talk her down, but when that failed I suggested that she call a suicide hotline. She called and the lady talked her down and she was okay. I got her to see a therapist.Four days ago, the only friend she had left at her university turned her back on her and made it clear that they could never be friends again. My friend doesn't take it well, but she's more angry than anything which is completely reasonable. Immediately after it happens she is bawling her eyes out and crying over the phone as we talked. I let her know that I care about her a lot and that I am there for her and after about forty-five minutes of talking, she's doing much better. She has thoughts of killing herself because she feels alone, but she's able to stifle them with help from her therapist.Okay so, fast forward to tonight. My friend is not able to think rationally. She is a complete wreck. She prefaced our conversation with the statement that she is considering killing herself tonight. At first I just tried to talk her down but there wasn't a shred of rationality in her tonight. A suicide hotline wouldn't even do it. My friend had been cutting herself all night (superficially), citing it is the only way she copes. She said that she had her pills at her side and was cutting more to prepare for tonight.At this point, I decide to call her campus PD. I couldn't live with myself if she had killed herself and I did nothing so I acted. About half an hour later they get to her dorm and talk her down and take her to the psych hospital.I feel like I did the right thing, but I feel like I betrayed her confidence and I keep feeling worse about it as time progresses.
